										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I encountered a strange issue on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pixel 2 XL</a> and thought it was worth sharing the problem, investigation and solution in case anyone experiences a similar issue.</p>
<p><span id="more-2452"></span><strong>The problem</strong><br />
One day I noticed that the videos I was recording on my Pixel 2 XL seemed silent. When playing back some videos, if I turned up the volume to it&#8217;s maximum I could just about hear loud events in the videos and a bit of hiss/static. This seemed odd as I hadn&#8217;t noticed volume problems during other regular activities that require the microphone (e.g. phone calls). As I have <a href="https://g400.co.uk/cam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous in-depth experience with audio on Android</a> and try to minimise phone upgrades for cost and environmental reasons, I decided to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>The investigation</strong><br />
The investigation went through a number of stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I visually inspected the parts of the phone concealing microphones in case any dirt was preventing the sound from reaching the microphone. Everything seemed relatively clean.</li>
<li>Next, I tried recording video using both the front and rear cameras, as I recalled reading that camera application sometimes uses different microphones depending on which camera is used. Unfortunately the result was the same with both cameras.</li>
<li>As I hadn&#8217;t noticed the problem when using the microphones for other purposes, I tried using a couple of audio recording apps. Both were able to record good quality audio with no problems.</li>
<li>To be sure it wasn&#8217;t a problem with the camera application I cleared its storage and cache, uninstalled updates, and ran the phone in safe mode and tried an alternative camera application. Still, the problem remained.
<li>Thus far, evidence was pointing towards problems only occurring when recording video. I was aware that Android allows developers to specify different audio sources when recording and decided to remind myself of what those different audio sources were. Lo and behold, <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder.AudioSource#CAMCORDER" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android has a dedicated &#8220;camcorder&#8221; audio source</a>. I went back to the alternative camera application (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/code/ci/master/tree/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open Camera</a>) and was pleased to see that, although &#8220;camcorder&#8221; was the default audio source, I could select a different audio source. I selected the &#8220;default&#8221; source, recorded a video and played the video back: it sounded fine!</li>
<li>Although I was happy to keep using Open Camera as a workaround, I still wanted to get to the bottom of the issue. Tracing the audio source selection down through the Android source code, it looked like the selection of actual microphones was handled in <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/architecture" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">device-specific code</a>. This seemed reasonable, as details of which microphone to use for what purpose is device-specific. It also meant that if the issue was a software issue it was likely to be affecting many others with a Pixel 2 XL, but a quick search suggested that the issue was not particularly common.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The solution</strong><br />
I paused and considered what I knew:</p>
<ol>
<li>At least one audio source was broken and at least one worked.</li>
<li>Despite claiming that the &#8220;camcorder&#8221; audio source uses a microphone with the &#8220;same orientation as the camera if available&#8221;, the camera orientation wasn&#8217;t affecting the brokenness of the &#8220;camcorder&#8221; audio source.</li>
<li>The issue was quite unlikely to be a software problem.</li>
<li>Affected videos sometimes had no audio and sometimes had very, very quiet audio.</li>
</ol>
<p>This suggested that one or more of the microphones was either defective or blocked. Of the three microphones on the Pixel 2 XL, <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7157629?hl=en-GB#2017" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two are front-facing and one is on the top of the phone</a>. If the problem was with a single microphone used for any camera orientation, the microphone on top of the phone was the most plausible candidate.</p>
<p>As damaging an already defective microphone didn&#8217;t matter, I used a paperclip to carefully remove hidden dirt from deep inside the hole for the microphone on top of the phone. This solved the problem and I was able to revert to using the &#8220;camcorder&#8221; audio source.</p>
<p><strong>Further thoughts</strong><br />
I wonder why the Pixel 2 XL doesn&#8217;t use the front-facing microphones when using the front-facing camera. Perhaps the one on top is optimised for picking up ambient noise? All very interesting. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The website of the month for July 2014 is <a href="http://pressurenet.io/">PressureNet.io</a>, the website for an app that aims to use the atmospheric pressure sensors of Android devices (coupled with their location-awareness) to build the highest resolution weather data collection system in the world. Currently the data collected is only used for a few fun apps as well as research, but it is hoped that eventually it will help significantly with weather forecasting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a disproportionately large number of Android apps specific to Cambridge &#8211; if you live, work in, study in or studied in Cambridge, you may find some of the apps below, which I hereby recommend, useful. This is by no means a finite list &#8211; from time to time I may highlight more, so <a href="twitter.com/g400_pub">follow on Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/?feed=rss2">use the RSS feed</a> or <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/">visit regularly</a>.</p>
<p>Before I leave you to read about the apps, I&#8217;d like to point out <a href="http://www.cambridgehouseprices.co.uk/">this enlightening Cambridge-related website</a>, tracking house prices in the city. Currently, it demonstrates the crippling situation for people who don&#8217;t already own property and/or who lack large sums of money &#8211; the prices and trends in Cambridge make property prices in the rest of the UK (in which it is still very difficult to buy property) look almost pleasant. I wish they&#8217;d sort out the supply problem both locally and nationally.</p>
<p>Finally, don&#8217;t forget <a href="http://theboatrace.org/">The Boat Race</a> next weekend!</p>

This is a fantastic little app that brings together much of the information you need when in Cambridge from the time of the next bus or train to the what&#8217;s on at the cinemas and theatres. It also contains information that is less easily available on mobile devices such as places to eat and drink and local cultural events. For tourists it has information on all of the tourist attractions and local hotels. Recently added features include a special offers section that features offers available at local establishments and a section for <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/345">walkcam2012</a>.</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Beer_Festival">The Cambridge Beer Festival</a>, coming up this year from the 20th to the 25th of May, is the UK&#8217;s second largest regional beer festival. The Cambridge Beer Festival app is a good tie-in, aiding exploration of the beers available in a meaningful and social way and providing a much more searchable and convenient list of the beers than the booklet given to attendees. I&#8217;d recommend the event to those who haven&#8217;t been (indeed, I&#8217;ve only had the time to attend since graduating) &#8211; it&#8217;s a good chance to sit and relax with friends on Jesus Green in the early summer and enjoy some of the surrounding environment and culture.</p>

A far more recent addition to the Android platform (a legacy from the era when apps were written with mainly in mind), the Cambridge Alumni app presents information such as news, research and events from <a href="www.alumni.cam.ac.uk">the Cambridge Alumni website</a> in a form that&#8217;s much easier to digest on a mobile device than the website itself. However, with the recent mobile-friendly redesign of <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">the main University of Cambridge website</a>, for how long will the Cambridge Alumni Android app remain relevant?</p>

If you were to visit <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/library/">the University of Cambridge Computer Lab&#8217;s library</a> and read my dissertation, you might notice that I had anticipated significant improvements to the audio hardware of phones:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mobile audio hardware may yet see a general improvement as voice communication capabilities become decreasingly important.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, that is relative to other potential functions of audio hardware &#8211; unfortunately the word limit prevented me from being more explanatory.</p>
<p>The preceding sentences in my dissertation detail the limitations I encountered:</p>
<blockquote><p>The main limitation is the quality, maximum amplitude and capabilities of the audio hardware of mobile devices, which still only perform satisfactorily at phone calls. When problems such as high THD are combined with limited amplitude and/or echoes, signal detection becomes very difficult. The limited spectrum over which the hardware performs well also prevents exploitation of more bandwidth, and ultrasonic communication.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the presumably improved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fidelity">fidelity</a> and reduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion">total harmonic distortion</a> of the HTC One&#8217;s speakers as well as increased acoustic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(telecommunications)">transmission</a> range and reduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microphone&#038;oldid=539162939#Measurements_and_specifications">microphone clipping</a> (enabling more successful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_cancellation">acoustic echo cancellation</a>) are welcome changes, the mixing of the data from the <a href="http://connect.dpreview.com/post/6522717512/htc-one-is-it-the-ultimate-camera-phone">dual membranes</a> of the microphones and SenseVoice&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response">frequency response</a> adjustment might have a more fun impact on the signal that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> framework would ultimately supply LocaMsg with.</p>
<p>I miss working in this area.</p>

<p>The video below shows <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/21/3101918/watch-this-projection-tech-inside-99-year-old-dome-poland">a pretty cool use</a> of advanced 3D modelling and projection technology.<br />

<p>Tomorrow morning, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Science_Laboratory">NASA&#8217;s Curiosity Rover</a> will attempt to land on Mars. This involves a range of technical challenges which must work correctly, during this first real test, for the rover to make it to the surface in a working state &#8211; the video below gives an exciting overview of the difficulties involved.<br />

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(laboratory)">Aquarius Lab</a> is one of the few underwater research facilities in the world dedicated to science. Recently it was visited by a reporter who made a short video about the facility and the lives of the &#8220;aquanauts&#8221; on board.<br />

<p>In other recent news, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-18550513">Stonehenge may have been built to unify</a> the native inhabitants of Great Britain and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/16/htc-hd2-gets-unofficial-android-4-1-jelly-bean-port/">the HD2 continues to be one of the most versatile smartphones in history</a>.</p>
<p>Now the entertainment section! The first of the two videos below was recorded in Cambridge and is a rather amusing portrayal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman">The Dark Knight</a> in real life. The second is particularly well made (I like the way the whole thing is done without colour) and is both amusing and scary at the same time.</p>

<p>The trailer for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_7)">the upcoming series of Doctor Who</a> was recently released and, for the first time in a while, features music from the show rather than music by <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/298">Two Steps from Hell</a>.<br />

<p>Finally, below is some music I have found recently and liked &#8211; some related to the theme of this post, some not. Of particular note is an interesting orchestral arrangement incorporating several songs by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Eyed_Peas">The Black Eyed Peas</a>. Also, from the excerpts I&#8217;ve heard, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises_(soundtrack)">the soundtrack of The Dark Knight Rises</a> sounds good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, it has been just over two months since <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/343">I reviewed the HTC One X</a> and I thought it was time for an update now that I&#8217;ve been using it for some time. I&#8217;ve been so busy lately that I haven&#8217;t had much time to do much technical fiddling with it, so I&#8217;m impressed that it has not only slotted into my life so seamlessly but that it does help me all of the time in ways that my previous phones didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Super Software</strong></p>
<p>On a general note, the One X&#8217;s software and hardware work together to make every experience with the device good. However, I want to highlight some hidden gems in the included software.</p>
<p>Back in the days of Windows Mobile, I was a big user of the tasks functionality to maintain a list of things I needed to do. However, as I moved to Android for the last few years, I gradually switched to solutions such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_note">Post-it notes</a> on things such as my desk. Now I&#8217;ve completely switched back to managing tasks on my mobile device again thanks to the excellent Tasks app on the One X.</p>

<p>HTC Watch, mentioned again in a section below, provides a decent range of films available for purchase and renting &#8211; the latter is often very attractively priced!</p>
<p><span id="more-476"></span><strong>Confused Camera</strong></p>
<p>I was correct with my suspicions that in the panorama mode, some feature matching is done to produce better results. What I didn&#8217;t realise however, was that this is done on the fly. I also didn&#8217;t realise that this overrides the input from the gyroscope and compass which the phone may be using to help work out the relative directions of each photo. Indeed, I only stumbled across this revelation accidentally while trying to take a panoramic photo of a relatively empty room with plain white walls &#8211; it was impossible! The phone was confused by the homogeneity of the surface and proceeded to suggest nonsensical directions in which to point the phone in order to take the next stage of the panoramic photo. No matter how I reacted to its suggestions, it would stitch the resulting photos together in an incorrect fashion, demonstrating that the relative positional metadata generated while taking the photos was used in the stitching process.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of situations though, the camera has been superb. Other than the sharpness issues identified in other reviews when you see the photos at their native resolution, the only other issue I could find with the camera software is that it seems to be more reluctant than it should be to use the LED flash. I&#8217;ve had to force the LED flash on manually a few times to get a better quality photo. I haven&#8217;t yet had the opportunity to take many photos in particularly dark situations, but that should be changing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Week">very soon</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Stunning Sound</strong></p>
<p>In my review I was quite critical of the sound produced by the included earphones, but I have since warmed to their sound &#8211; relative to my HD2&#8217;s earphones, they&#8217;re considerably more audible over background noise (e.g. traffic) without being uncomfortably loud. This is a very practical benefit and as a consequence I now consider the audio hardware to be a considerable asset of the device, though I still make sure Beats Audio is off. Less practical tests also reveal the audio hardware to be of a <a href="http://st.gsmarena.com/vv/reviewsimg/htc-one-x/gsmarena_a001.png">superior nature</a> to some of my <a href="http://st.gsmarena.com/vv/reviewsimg/htc-hd2/gsmarena_a001.png">previous</a> <a href="http://st.gsmarena.com/vv/reviewsimg/htc-touch-diamond/audio/gsmarena_a001.png">phones</a>.</p>
<p><strong>More Power!</strong></p>
<p>Weirdly enough, I have encountered two situations where the phone was consuming power at crippling rate. To be fair, both situations should cause considerable power drain but the phone&#8217;s (apparently planned) reaction to both was something I&#8217;d never seen before.</p>
<p>The first situation involved the phone being attached to a screen via <a href="http://www.htcaccessorystore.com/uk/p_htc_item.aspx?i=218634">the official MHL adapter</a>, which supplies some power to the phone alongside its primary purpose: putting what you can see on your phone onto a much bigger screen. I have no trouble playing items purchased via <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/how-htc-watch-delivers-movie-magic-955429">HTC Watch</a> (5p to rent films is an awesome price!) via the MHL adapter. However, when I stream content from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/">iPlayer</a> over 3G to the phone and attempt to watch it on a bigger screen via the MHL adapter, I get the message below and the phone continues to use its own battery power at such a rate that I think the available external power isn&#8217;t actually used at all.</p>
<div id="attachment_495" style="width: 665px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/476/htc_one_x_mhl_iplayer_dialog" rel="attachment wp-att-495"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-495" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/htc_one_x_mhl_iplayer_dialog.png" alt="&quot;Your phone is using more current than the charger is able to deliver. Please power off your phone or close unused applications.&quot;" title="The HTC One X&#039;s reaction to streaming iPlayer video over 3G while outputting it via MHL" width="655" height="350" class="size-full wp-image-495" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/htc_one_x_mhl_iplayer_dialog.png 655w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/htc_one_x_mhl_iplayer_dialog-300x160.png 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/htc_one_x_mhl_iplayer_dialog-500x267.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-495" class="wp-caption-text">The HTC One X&#8217;s reaction to streaming iPlayer video over 3G while outputting it via MHL</p></div>
<p>That same situation also causes the phone to get close to becoming too hot &#8211; something I&#8217;ve learned from experience that a flashing red and green notification light indicates. Once it did suddenly die as a result of overheating and I&#8217;ve kept an eye out for that flashing light since, cooling it with ice or pausing iPlayer for a short while (the notification light returns to normal when the phone has cooled down enough).</p>
<p>The second situation is one that I don&#8217;t regularly put the phone in but is a further confirmation of the power the phone&#8217;s components (particularly the large and high-res screen) need. During a phone call if you start the camera application, you are told that you&#8217;re unable to use the flash while in a phone call.</p>
<div id="attachment_497" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/htc_one_x_camera_flash_call.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-497" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/htc_one_x_camera_flash_call-1024x576.png" alt="&quot;Unable to use flash because a phone call is in progress.&quot;" title="The HTC One X&#039;s reaction to use of the camera during a phone call" width="584" height="328" class="size-large wp-image-497" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/htc_one_x_camera_flash_call-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/htc_one_x_camera_flash_call-300x168.png 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/htc_one_x_camera_flash_call-500x281.png 500w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/htc_one_x_camera_flash_call.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-497" class="wp-caption-text">The HTC One X&#8217;s reaction to use of the camera during a phone call</p></div>
<p>The phone also gets fairly warm when playing serious games, though I would expect this with any device. It&#8217;s pretty cool to play games of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0oZ9vgOYUE">quality and scale of GTA 3</a> on the move &#8211; the controls for that game in particular have been translated to mobile devices well. Of course, ones designed for Tegra 3 specifically have better controls and graphics though they often feel more like they&#8217;ve been designed to show off the capabilities of the hardware than anything else. I do like the scale and ambition of some of the games designed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(fifth_generation)">fifth</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(sixth_generation)">sixth</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(seventh_generation)">seventh</a> generation video game consoles, which we are starting to see being ported to mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>So, in summary, the One X&#8217;s software is generally excellent, the panoramic mode on the camera can get confused when there aren&#8217;t many visual features to determine the relative positioning of photos, the audio quality and headphones are actually quite good, HTC Watch lets you rent films incredibly cheaply, the screen uses a large proportion of the current the battery or charger can sustain and you can play some pretty cool games (I&#8217;ve never really got games like Angry Birds). The phone has also had quite a few updates which have fixed a few of the small bugs that every new device seems to have these days and, in case you didn&#8217;t hear, <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2182270/htc-playstation-certfied">the One X will also be getting Playstation games</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The website of the month for June 2012 is <a href="http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/">thou shalt not commit logical fallacies</a> &#8211; a handy and good-looking website and creative commons licensed poster with quick explanations of a range of logical fallacies. Apologies for the slight lateness of this post &#8211; this month has been and will continue to be unusually busy for me. However, I have built up a larger than usual range of links to share and have enough time to do them all reasonable justice. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://deaddrops.com/">Dead Drops</a> is an interesting anonymous, offline, peer to peer file-sharing network consisting of USB flash drives are embedded into walls, buildings and curbs accessible to anybody in public space. The size of the network seems to be increasing at a good pace too, so keep an eye on it if there are none near you currently!</p>
<p>You may have missed a few less-obvious bits of mobile news lately amongst the various announcements from Apple, HTC, Samsung, Sony and others. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/4/2998403/apple-samsung-99-percent-profit-asymco">Here are some fascinating illustrations</a> of which smartphone designers/manufacturers are making money today and how this has been changing over the last 5 or so years. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/11/3013664/lg-ls970-eclipse-4g-lte-quad-core-snapdragon-s4-rumor">This is an interesting insight</a> into what those companies are cooking up for late 2012 and some of 2013. Hopefully we&#8217;ll see more software able to put the increasingly excessive power and speed to good use.</p>
<p>Google recently produced <a href="http://www.google.com/green/storyofsend/">a friendly animation explaining the process of sending an email via Gmail</a> &#8211; potentially insightful if you don&#8217;t know how a lot of the magic of the Internet happens. It features landline broadband with a Wi-Fi router on one end and a cellular (mobile) network on the other end, which leads me to a piece of information the companies above should find interesting: the HTC HD2 is one of the most popular Android phones <a href="http://opensignalmaps.com/reports/fragmentation.php">according to one study</a> (34th, if I&#8217;ve counted correctly), despite being shipped with a completely different operating system. Also, speaking of Android, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/18/3028202/mk802-android-usb-hdmi-stick">you can now get USB sticks that run Android increasingly cheaply</a>.</p>
<p>I have a few links on broader research this month too: researchers at the MIT Media Lab <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/13/3018142/zeron-mit-media-lab-levitation">have been up to some pretty cool stuff with magnets</a>, Monmouth (in Wales) <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/17/3026058/monmouth-monmouthpedia-wikipedia-town">has become the world&#8217;s first Wikipedia town</a>, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/17/3026074/starlite-maurice-ward-plastic-fireproof">Starlite is a miracle material that could be lost forever</a>, <a href="http://www.mappinglife.org/">the Map of Life</a> brings together in an easily-usable way all types of information about species distribution to support the understanding and protection of the world&#8217;s biodiversity.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Home/Cambridge-University-Press-to-hand-over-printing-work-to-another-firm-06062012.htm">Cambridge University Press, the world‚Äôs oldest printing and publishing company</a>, is handing its printing business &#8211; it does make sense to print books closer to where they are needed, though there are many other other arguments for and against what is truly the end of an era. It was also nice to see <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18328382">the Olympic torch in Ireland</a>, you can view an informative and historically accurate recreation of the great pyramids from your browser <a href="http://giza3d.3ds.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.halproject.com/">this website</a> and the screensavers it hosts are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwBmPiOmEGQ">good</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I leave you with two nice tracks from the recently released Madagascar 3 soundtrack and news that I hope to do one or two further posts this week, but will then be too busy to post for a few weeks again.</p>

<p><span id="more-343"></span></p>
<p><strong>Design and build quality</strong></p>
<p>Design has been one of HTC&#8217;s strengths since since <a href="http://www.oneandco.com/casestudy_01.html">working with</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/03/htc-acquires-design-firm-one-and-co/">eventually acquiring</a> One &#038; Co. It is therefore pleasing that HTC has returned to exploiting this strength after two years of phones converging on a chunky (by today&#8217;s standards), largely aluminium 4.3-inch-screened device.</p>

<p>The One X looks stunning from every angle. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gorilla_Glass&#038;oldid=485604923#Gorilla_Glass_2.0">Gorilla Glass 2</a> on the front slopes near-seamlessly into the curved polycarbonate unibody &#8211; the small bump at the edge of the screen providing tactile feedback when you&#8217;ve swiped or dragged far enough. The vast majority of the space on the front of the device is taken up by the screen and yet through the wrapping around of the unibody and the curving and sloping of the screen&#8217;s edges, it certainly differentiates itself from the considerable number of large black slabs on the market.</p>
<div id="attachment_411" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/343/htc_one_x_screen" rel="attachment wp-att-411"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-411" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_Screen.jpg" alt="HTC One X Screen" title="HTC One X Screen" width="1000" height="750" class="size-full wp-image-411" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_Screen.jpg 1000w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_Screen-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_Screen-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-411" class="wp-caption-text">The screen of the HTC One X</p></div>
<p>The screen itself looks superb &#8211; pixels are virtually invisible to the naked eye, colour reproduction is as good as I&#8217;ve seen for a LCD and brightness is good too. Strangely, my One X didn&#8217;t have the automatic backlight adjustment on by default.</p>
<div id="attachment_417" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/343/htc_one_x_capacitive_buttons" rel="attachment wp-att-417"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-417" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_capacitive_buttons-1024x400.jpg" alt="The HTC One X&#039;s capacitive buttons" title="The HTC One X&#039;s capacitive buttons" width="584" height="228" class="size-large wp-image-417" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_capacitive_buttons-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_capacitive_buttons-300x117.jpg 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_capacitive_buttons-500x195.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-417" class="wp-caption-text">The HTC One X&#039;s capacitive buttons</p></div>
<p>Below the screen are three capacitive buttons with haptic feedback. The layout of the buttons is somewhat frustrating and unlike other devices of mine with a back button. Instead of placing the back button near the thumb if holding the device in your right hand, it is actually the furthest button and not easy to reach in a one-handed grip. Instead, the easiest button to press is the less  useful multitasking button. However, this is more of an issue with the direction that Android is heading in than the One X as the Samsung Galaxy Nexus has the same on-screen button layout and a similarly large screen.</p>
<p>Thus far the the earpiece and external speaker have remained dirt-free, mainly due to the fact the holes drilled through the phone&#8217;s polycarbonate shell are incredibly small. The volume when playing music seems good, though I have missed a few calls in noisy environments &#8211; perhaps an issue with volume but also perhaps due to the poorer than average vibration capabilities or just me not yet being familiar with the ringtone (I&#8217;ve got mine set to <a href="http://www.zedge.net/ringtone/1447298/">an interesting blast from the past</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the main camera is not recessed relative to the protruding metal ring around it, making it a target for scratches. Similarly, the front-facing camera is also sub-optimally designed &#8211; this time being so small and so far recessed that it&#8217;s prone to picking up dirt.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons I have the white version of the One X, and it is worth noting that it does pick up some dirt and colours from clothes. Nothing that a rub and sometimes a drop or two of water can&#8217;t handle though.</p>

<p>Finally, and surprisingly, the device is very light &#8211; lighter than the HD2 and though it&#8217;s not as light as the Touch Diamond, it feels as light. This is likely due to the lack of metal used in the phone&#8217;s polycarbonate unibody shell as well as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_polymer_battery">lithium-ion polymer</a> battery.</p>

<p>I am a fan of HTC Sense &#8211; while using plain Android on my HD2 I did miss a lot of the shortcuts and functionality it that Sense provided me with as well as the high quality and uniformly themed widgets. Sense 4, which can be found on the One X, cuts out many of the nice but frivolous animations. There are still a limited number of visually pleasing enhancements such as a limited third dimension to the homescreen transitions. It is disappointing to see the &#8216;pinch to switch tabs&#8217; feature no longer in the browser and <a href="http://www.htcsense.com/">HTCSense.com</a> gone for now (I hope to see something similarly useful in its place soon). I am looking forward to testing the included Movie Editor app as I record more videos.</p>
<p>One annoyance which will hopefully eventually disappear is that a lot of apps, sometimes inexplicably, cause a menu button to be displayed at the bottom of the screen. This is not much of an issue when it facilitates use of an older application but it also displays when running applications such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nvidia.demo.glowball">NVIDIA&#8217;s Glowball</a>, which appears to have no use for it. From a developer&#8217;s perspective, I suspect HTC may be checking for the presence of methods such as <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onCreateOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu)">onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu)</a> but not running them to get a return value for fear that applications could do something in reaction other than populate a menu and say whether or not it should be displayed.</p>

<p>The camera software, as HTC will tell you, is fantastic. I do find it slightly misleading though that the default camera mode is called &#8216;Auto&#8217; but never invokes features from other modes. It would be handy and not infeasible for it to automatically turn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">HDR</a> on or off based on lighting conditions, turn on portrait or group portrait based on face detection, landscape and close up based on autofocus feedback and panorama based on camera motion. I did encounter one bug a number of times, though not enough to yet be sure of how to reproduce it: periodic focus hunting while recording video, as featured in the video below.</p>
<p><object width="560" height="315" ><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="movie" value="http://www.facebook.com/v/10150663172958924" /><embed src="http://www.facebook.com/v/10150663172958924" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="315"></embed></object></p>
<p>Overall the camera is not perfect and it&#8217;s still perfectly capable of taking bad photos in the right conditions, but it&#8217;s definitely a lot easier to use and takes good photos in far more conditions than any other phone camera I&#8217;ve seen. The panorama mode, for example, seems to do some matching of features in images rather than na√Øvely fading them into each other, but doesn&#8217;t warp the images where necessary to match both nearer and further objects. I&#8217;ve not yet been in good situations to test the single-LED flash which supposedly flashes with one of five brightness levels depending on the distance of the subject.</p>

<p>I must disagree with HTC over the quality of their music software. Not only does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Electronics">Beats Audio</a> by definition reduce the authenticity of the music (unless the response curve of the hardware through which the audio is being played is known and compensated for) but even when I turned it off I found that my musical experience with the included earphones was inferior to that of my previous HTC devices. I found the external speaker to be more satisfactory compared to my previous devices though and quite loud. I prefer Android&#8217;s default music application to the custom music application included &#8211; as well as hiding the list of files currently playing in a popover menu (and calling it a queue, with the currently playing file being referred to as &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; &#8211; something that caused me to be unable to get to the list of currently playing files for several days), the application seems to go to the &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; screen if you ever leave it and come back to the application. This is particularly annoying as I like to browse through my files, searching for the next thing I want to hear, and sometimes have to leave the application briefly. Jumping to &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; is pointless to me as the same information and controls are available on the lockscreen, as a widget and as a notification.</p>

<p>I have encountered occasional software glitches, but nothing that&#8217;s unusual these days for the first firmware version. Bugs have included the camera failing to start successfully once and the screen occasionally turning back on immediately after turning it off.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware and Gaming</strong></p>
<p>Few people typically use their phone in such a way that a quad-core 1.5GHz CPU is particularly necessary. Indeed, I am not amongst that few. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that it can&#8217;t be noticed even during the most mundane tasks. Even when running Android 2.3, which it was pretty good at, my HD2 would occasionally lag for a moment before switching <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">activities</a> and sometimes even have to catch up with a few back button presses. However, the One X flies through all screen transitions. The browser loads with ease and smoothly scrolls through pages that the HD2&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)">single-core 1GHz Scorpion CPU</a> would not enjoy loading and jerkily scroll through. The phone manages to keep this smoothness up even when it&#8217;s up to a variety of tasks at once.</p>

The right screenshot shows the train journey mentioned in the text below and many hours of little activity. For me, both days were unusually hard on the battery.</p></div>
<p>Surprisingly, this speed is achieved with impressively low power consumption. Despite the larger screen and much more powerful processor, the One X happily survived a day involving a 50-minute-long train journey spent listening to music while uploading photos and videos over a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Speed_Packet_Access">HSPA</a>-only mobile network while I also reviewed and captioned the photos and videos. Such abuse would&#8217;ve drained about half of the HD2&#8217;s battery, but only used 20-30% of the One X&#8217;s battery. Excluding the first day, as the battery takes a few charges to exhibit normal battery life, the battery has easily lasted all day for me so far despite all of the setting up, testing and real use I&#8217;ve put it through (I had a busy weekend).</p>
<p>Some features I have not yet tested include Bluetooth, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance">DLNA</a>, GPS, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Direct">Wi-Fi Direct</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication">NFC</a> &#8211; I tend not to use these features regularly, though it is nice to have them there for the occasions when they are useful.</p>
<p>Thus far I haven&#8217;t had too much opportunity to explore Tegra-specific games other than <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nvidia.demo.glowball">Glowball</a>, which looks fantastic though seems to be optimised for tablets. Non-Tegra-specific games are super-smooth but obviously have more average graphics. I was amused to see that Teeter was included and that (to the point I&#8217;ve played it to) it&#8217;s still the same as the original version on the HTC Touch Diamond.</p>

<p>Unlike most phones lately, which have been priced too highly or have struggled to stand out from the competition, I think the One X is competitively priced at just under ¬£500 in the UK. However, if like most people you don&#8217;t purchase your phones outright and instead get them with a contract, the news is worse &#8211; most contracts in the UK at the moment that include phones are awfully priced. It&#8217;s easier to lose money relative to buying the phone outright than get it subsidised by your network. Two and a half years ago my HTC HD2, for example, was effectively ¬£190 cheaper with a contract than it was to buy outright. This is the fault of the networks and something to be wary of in general as they clearly attempt to settle <a href="http://www.cramton.umd.edu/papers2000-2004/01nao-cramton-report-on-uk-3g-auction.pdf">their 3G spectrum auction debts</a> and save for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/oct/11/4g-spectrum-auction">the 4G spectrum auction that will hopefully happen in the next year or so</a>.</p>

<p>The HTC One X is the best phone available today. But is it the phone you&#8217;ve been waiting for? Possibly.</p>
<p>Small-handed people would struggle to use it due to its sheer size &#8211; for these people I would not recommend the One X and I would be wary of suggesting its smaller sibling S, which has a similar height though reduced width and thickness. Of HTC&#8217;s One range, probably only One V is suitable if size is your concern. The One V is also suitable for those who don&#8217;t need the latest and greatest phone &#8211; with similar specs to the HD2 and the same camera software as the One X, it is actually pretty good despite being roughly half the price of its larger siblings.</p>
<p>If you need a lot of data while on the go, the lack of microSD card slot is a problem though the 32GB of internal storage is generous. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fonleap.pocketvm">PocketVM</a> will let you store more files than you otherwise could while wirelessly letting you see them on any computer you come to. And if that&#8217;s not enough, the One X comes with 25GB of cloud storage.</p>
<p>Of considerable concern is what Apple and Samsung may release later this year. However, you know more about this than you might think &#8211; the pros and cons of the Android and iOS ecosystems are unlikely to change rapidly, Apple rarely varies a number of specs (e.g. screen size) and Samsung is highly likely to use an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED">AMOLED</a> screen.</p>
<p>I am unfortunate enough to live in a part of the world that doesn&#8217;t look likely to get any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution">LTE</a> networks at all until 2013, and probably won&#8217;t get a decent level of coverage until near the middle of this decade. However, if you would benefit from a phone with 4G capabilities then the HTC One X might not be for you. Luckily, the HTC One XL is near-identical except it&#8217;s powered by a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon, has LTE capabilities and has only 16GB of internal storage (presumably you&#8217;re supposed to store more online and take advantage of the superior mobile network speeds).</p>
<p>Personally, I would highly recommend the One X. It&#8217;s obviously not for everyone (hence the One S and One V), but it is certainly the phone that many people have been waiting for: it is, in spirit, the <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/90">HD3</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The website of the month for April 2012 is <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>, for unveiling today a range of revolutionary new features, that build on their existing wide range of services in innovative ways&#8230;<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s only Google&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day">April Fools&#8217; Day</a> efforts that I am making website(s) of the month:</p>

<p>In other (but related) news, here is a nice short video about Colossus, the world&#8217;s first electronic programmable computer, made by Google:<br />
<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/knXWMjIA59c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_computing_hardware&#038;oldid=484539784#Early_computer_characteristics">Here is an interesting table</a> that gives an idea of where Colossus sits in terms of capabilities amongst the world&#8217;s earliest computers, including EDSAC (the world&#8217;s first <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/conference/EDSAC99/history.html">&#8220;complete and fully operational regular electronic digital stored program computer&#8221;</a> which was made at the University of Cambridge Computer Lab or, as it was known then, Mathematical Lab). On a related note, did you know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leper_Chapel,_Cambridge">the Leper Chapel</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmarket_Road,_Cambridge">Newmarket Road</a> is <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/old-meets-new-at-800-year-old-leper-chapel/">the oldest complete surviving building in Cambridge</a>?</p>
<p>This month some creative uses of technology caught my eye. Microsoft recently released a tool to create cliplets. Don&#8217;t know what they are? Neither did I before watching the video, but I think they look cool and will be giving the tool a try.<br />

Another interesting item is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/13/2866565/miselu-neiru-android-social-keyboard">Miselu&#8217;s Neiru keyboard</a> &#8211; an interesting musical Android device that could potentially be handy for scoring on the go. Finally, at the University of Cambridge a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms">Lego Mindstorms</a> kit is being used in an interesting way:<br />
<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WBEtUJmp05w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
While on the subject of interesting science, there&#8217;s a fascinating video showing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ocean_current&#038;oldid=484139270#Function">ocean surface currents</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/7009056027/">here</a>, a cool <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohorovi%C4%8Di%C4%87_discontinuity">Moho boundary</a> map <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17312368">here</a> and a fantastic image of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way">the Milky Way</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17539315">here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, below is a good short film written and directed by Graham Linehan, creator of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Ted">Father Ted</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd">The IT Crowd</a>. Called <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Friend">Hello Friend</a></strong>, it features the arrival of an increasingly uncooperative and sinister Internet-related device into someone&#8217;s life. Personally, I find the instruction manual quite amusing.<br />

<p>Coming up on this blog later this month (hopefully) will be a review of the HTC One X that I&#8217;ve been asked to do, as I&#8217;m finally upgrading to the One X from the amazing, but now ageing (approx. 2.5 year old), <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/windows-mobile/two-years-later-the-amazing-htc-hd2/">HTC HD2</a>.</p>
