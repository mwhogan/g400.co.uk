										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The population of Cambridgeshire is growing and there&#8217;s plenty of demand for further growth, but developing new places for people to live, work and play in Cambridgeshire is tricky. Cambridge itself is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Green_Belt">surrounded by green belt</a> that few seem willing to sacrifice, despite much of it being described as dull and featureless.&nbsp;There&#8217;s lots of development around Peterborough, but it cannot be expected to handle all of the population growth. A few new towns are being developed (Cambourne and Northstowe), but these are not well suited to grow beyond a certain size.</p>
<p>Notably, Cambridgeshire is curious in that it has two small-ish cities but does not yet have any large towns like Wellingborough, Corby and Kettering in neighbouring Northamptonshire. Many of the bigger towns to the east of the county (March, Wisbech and the city of Ely) are surrounded by flat, low-lying land that&#8217;s at risk of flooding by both river and, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming">in the longer term</a>, sea. On this basis, I would suggest that these towns should not be top of the list for future growth. However, the bigger towns in the west of Cambridgeshire are better suited to handling significant growth and providing Cambridgeshire with some large towns: Huntingdon and St Neots.</p>
<p><span id="more-2305"></span>There are some good reasons to be pro-development, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most certain ways to ensure the maintenance and perhaps even growth existing facilities if by growing the population they serve. For example, the argument for keeping the current range of services at Hinchingbrooke Hospital would be increasingly difficult if the Huntingdon area did not soak up much of Cambridgeshire&#8217;s population growth. A growing population <a href="https://www.nwangliaft.nhs.uk/about-us/trust-news/department-of-health-funding-approval-for-hinchingbrooke-hospital/">is already acknowledged as a factor</a> in future investment decisions.</li>
<li>By allowing large scale development, such as Alconbury Weald, you generally end up with a well-thought-out development with appropriate new facilities, green space, utilities improvements, etc. Conversely, by resisting large scale development you end up with somewhere like Cambridge or London where the quality of homes is decreasing, the price of homes is ridiculous and there are few improvements to facilities, green space, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously there&#8217;s far more discussion and debate to be had in this area, but the point of this post is not to fully examine Cambridgeshire&#8217;s growth and development opportunities or the nationwide need for growth and development. Instead, like <a href="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409">Cambridge Automated Metro</a>, I&#8217;d like to present a &#8220;What If&#8221; scenario.</p>
<p><strong>What if we strategically grew Huntingdon and St Neots towards the size of Wellingborough, Corby and Kettering?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll focus on Huntingdon in this post for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s well placed to be a focal point for Cambridgeshire other than Cambridge and Peterborough: as well as geographically, various county-wide services are headquartered there, Cambridgeshire County Council will soon be moving its headquarters to the area and it&#8217;s where a number of major transport routes (significant well beyond Cambridgeshire) meet.</li>
<li>There are some significant settlements (e.g. Godmanchester and Brampton) that have functionally been suburbs of Huntingdon for a long time.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s plenty of housebuilding occurring locally including, most notably, Alconbury Weald.</li>
<li>The local road network is about to change significantly: the ongoing A14 upgrade will see significant sections of dual carriageway in the area (Cambridge Services to Huntingdon town centre, Alconbury to Hinchingbrooke, Stukeley Meadows to Brampton Hut) become significantly underloaded, and the Alconbury Weald development is nearing the point of having its own road connection to Huntingdon.</li>
<li>Cambourne and Northstowe, like Alconbury Weald, have been built to be dependent on a larger nearby settlement for a larger range of facilities (e.g. retail, leisure, hospitals, work). The intention was probably for these to depend on Cambridge, but they also have good access to Huntingdon.</li>
<li>There are likely to be significant changes to the south of St Neots, with the Oxford to Cambridge expressway and railway due to run in that corridor, but these are still in early planning stages (e.g. the precise routes each project will take have not yet been decided).</li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting question, relevant to the section below, is the relationship between St Ives and Huntingdon. As both grow, are they close enough and related enough to be considered parts of a single greater area? The distance between them is an argument against, but it&#8217;s notable that much of the gap between them is also populated (via the villages of Houghton and Wyton) and in a number of ways St Ives and Huntingdon are treated as one. For example, there&#8217;s no overlap in terms of major supermarkets: Huntingdon has Tesco, Sainsbury&#8217;s, M&#038;S, Lidl and Aldi whereas St Ives has Wairtose, Morrisons and a Co-Op.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of creating a &#8220;Greater Huntingdon&#8221;, incorporating nearby settlements and development, could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A larger budget for events in the area and for marketing of the area for retail and tourism.</li>
<li>The significant population of the area being more easily recognisable to those looking to visit or invest in the area.</li>
<li>Better strategic planning for the area, hopefully resulting in long-term improvements to roads, public transport, amenities, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Greater Huntingdon Map</strong><br />
The main point of this post, like Cambridge Automated Metro, is to exhibit a &#8220;What If&#8221; map. Putting everything above together, along with a variety of developments, improvements, etc. that have been proposed or are under construction, produces an idea of what Huntingdon and the surrounding area could look like. Please note that my research has not been overly thorough, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to find some significant or insurmountable obstacles (e.g. wind turbines, historic landfill sites) to some more speculative features on the map. However, I have done my best to take account of many non-obvious restrictions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest">SSSIs</a> and other important green space, A14(M) and A1(M) borrow pits, and land prone to flooding. The research process has certainly been interesting and I&#8217;ve learned a lot about the history of the area. I am also bound to keep tinkering with the map and quietly updating this post: every time I look at it I see at least one thing that&#8217;s not quite right.</p>
<p>I present to you how Greater Huntingdon could look in a few decades, with a population of approximately 100,000:<br />

<li>Pink: other employment</li>
<li>Green: large public green space</li>
<li>Light blue (and very fuzzy): potential areas for further development</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes on map features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The level of detail on the map is fairly arbitrary: clearly I&#8217;ve taken more interest in some areas than others. For example, the whole of Huntingdon town centre is marked as retail (despite the substantial number of homes, Huntingdonshire District Council HQ, etc.) whereas the new Cambridgeshire County Council HQ gets its own purple blob. It would be extremely time consuming to add a great amount of detail across the map, such as an appropriately coloured blob for every shop and green space.
<li>I&#8217;ve given names to some future developments to help make the map more intelligible. For clarity, I&#8217;ve generally reused existing placenames and augmented them. For example, as well as Stukeley Meadows, we now have Stukeley Hillside. They&#8217;re very much just placeholders though and many could be improved.</li>
<li>This map deliberately doesn&#8217;t make it clear what is within Greater Huntingdon and what&#8217;s just near it. Exactly where the line could and should be drawn is up for debate. As discussed above, Godmanchester, Brampton and Alconbury Weald are very strong candidates. Given Alconbury Weald, the Stukeleys and the Alconburys are not unreasonable candidates too. St Ives is more debatable, though it will soon be connected to Huntingdon and Godmanchester by a dual carriageway virtually dedicated to the three towns and, as discussed above, Huntingdon and St Ives are already treated as one on some levels. If St Ives is included, it makes sense to include everything between Huntingdon and St Ives. The population figure includes all of these as well as Fenstanton, the Offords and Buckden, as these would be close satellite villages.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve included a third river crossing as it has been in the news again recently. From what I can remember, any time there has been talk of a third river crossing, it has been from Godmanchester to Hartford. I&#8217;ve included that on the map as a dotted line, along with two alternative options, from Godmanchester to Hinchingbrooke and Godmanchester to Brampton. There are a couple of reasons for this: Brampton Road and its junctions (specifically Hinchingbrooke Park Road and the train station junction) are well known for being overwhelmed for a number of hours every day (this seems likely to get worse with the A14 upgrade) and both options would also provide a fourth vehicular route for crossing the East Coast Main Line. As usual, there has been thinking about some detail (e.g. notice how the Godmanchester-Brampton link follows some of the path of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettering,_Thrapston_and_Huntingdon_Railway">the old Huntingdon-Kettering railway</a>), but there&#8217;s plenty more that I&#8217;d need to investigate before considering the proposal serious. The Godmanchester to Hartford crossing is still a useful and valid option for allowing A1307 and A1198 traffic to reach the A141 without going through Huntingdon.</li>
<li>An improved A141 (partially on a new alignment), which has been a distant plan for some time, is included. I&#8217;ve suggested dualling this to Wyton airfield as it&#8217;s already quite busy at peak times and will be made yet busier by the new developments. It would be nice for some of junctions it has to be <a href="https://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Grade_Separated_Junction">grade-separated</a>, but that would require a more significant upgrade proposal (it would have to have far fewer junctions spend much of its length running significantly below or above the natural ground level).</li>
<li>Given the third river crossing and improved A141, I&#8217;ve included the development of Wyton airfield (a little different from the proposed masterplan: much more green space), which would become much more accessible.</li>
<li>After researching and drawing the map, potential future areas for development (beyond specific current proposals) became clearer, and I&#8217;ve marked these as very fuzzy light-blue blobs. Topography and major roads make much development to the west difficult. There is much more potential around the southern edge of Godmanchester and to the north and north-east of Huntingdon though.</li>
<li>There are various other minor interesting things on the map, such as an extension of Huntingdon Retail Park to the north of the A141 and something interesting on Views Common (to make the most of the good access) but, as with Cambridge Automated Metro, I&#8217;ll leave such details for others to find and think about for themselves.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently stumbled across <a href="http://www.cambridge-connect.uk/">the website of Cambridge Connect</a>, an initiative &#8220;to help create an enduring system of rapid and sustainable transit that would help address the transport challenges facing Cambridge, while ensuring that the social, educational, economic, environmental, historic and cultural qualities that define the City are maintained and enhanced&#8221;. So far the energies of Cambridge Connect seem to have been mostly spent investigating and proposing a light rail rapid transit system for Cambridge, something that I agree needs to be pursued as a long-term transport solution for the city and surrounding areas. It&#8217;s also probably a good time to propose the idea again because, as I initially feared, it looks like Cambridge&#8217;s city deal money is almost certainly going to be mostly spent on relatively piecemeal improvements that make Cambridge a less attractive place to live for most people.</p>

<p><span id="more-2175"></span>When initially looking through the Cambridge Connect website, and after having already decided to post about it, I was pleased to notice that <a href="http://www.cambridge-connect.uk/background/">it talks a little</a> about <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409">my Cambridge Automated Metro (CAM) proposal</a>. Indeed, a number of the ideas are preserved: <a href="http://www.cambridge-connect.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CambridgeConnect_NewtonLine_v5.0.jpg">the proposed Isaac Newton line</a> has some similarities to parts of all of CAM&#8217;s lines and some of CAM&#8217;s proposed extensions (though it cuts a corner by going directly under the historic city centre), and <a href="http://www.cambridge-connect.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CambridgeConnect_NewtonLine_ExtensionABC_v5.0.pdf">extensions A and B</a> connect many of the other areas covered by CAM. The idea of a main line and various extensions is also similar to CAM&#8217;s division into three lines that could be built at separate times.</p>
<p>While the initial CAM proposal was primarily an attempt to stoke imaginations and ambition while generating debate, Cambridge Connect does not mention the small amount of headway I made in <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1659">a later post</a> with thoughts on how to make the idea less financially infeasible:</p>
<blockquote><p>By skirting around the edge of the city to the south and north-west, the North and South lines could have significant ground-level sections, reducing costs. Additional complexity-reducing and cost-cutting measures could include the Chesterton to Cambridge Science Park section of the North line making use of Stourbridge Common for a cut-and-cover section and runing at ground level parallel to the train line when it meets that.</p></blockquote>
<p>It looks those behind Cambridge Connect had similar thoughts though, as their Isaac Newton line proposal does feature ground-level running to the south and north-west of Cambridge. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Overall, while I do quite like some of the unique elements of my CAM proposal (e.g. that it is an X-system rather than something more like a Secant-system), I am pleased to see a similar proposal that has benefited from having far more time and effort poured into it. I do hope that it will result in more concrete action and take Cambridge closer to having public transport that isn&#8217;t so bad that it drives people to cycling. Maybe someday I&#8217;ll get round to investigating CAM&#8217;s extensions further and proposing <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1890">Cambridge Countryside City</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remaining with the recently mentioned subject of <a href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/a14-cambridge-to-huntingdon-improvement-scheme/">the soon to start A14 upgrade</a> between Cambridge and Huntingdon (technically Milton to Ellington), I recently stumbled across <a href="http://www.pathetic.org.uk/secretive/a14m/">an entry about the A14(M)</a> on an interesting website called <a href="http://www.pathetic.org.uk/">Pathetic Motorways</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2160"></span>Pathetic Motorways aims to research, document and photograph a range of odd motorways, from those that were never (or only partially) built and those that have been renumbered to those that have been lost (through downgrade or abandonment) and those that are very short (i.e. &#8220;pathetic&#8221;). It certainly helps to explain some of the strange features of the motorways around today. London&#8217;s Ringways project, a significant feature on Pathetic Motorways, has been <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/100">covered here before</a>.</p>
<p>The A14(M) has an interesting history, explained fully on Pathetic Motorways. However, it also has an interesting future. A brief glance through <a href="http://assets.highways.gov.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/roads/road-projects/a14-cambridge-to-huntingdon-improvement/A14_s56%20Plan_ES%20Figure%201.1%20Site%20Location%20and%20Context.pdf">the detailed A14 upgrade maps</a> (I pity anyone who has to read through the vast quantity of accompanying documentation) suggests that the small and secretive A14(M) will remain after the impending upgrade, <a href="http://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/TR010018/2.%20Post-Submission/Application%20Documents/Drawings/A14%202.10%20Traffic%20Regulation%20Measures%20Plan-SLP-Sheet%2028%20of%2029.pdf">possibly becoming</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1307_road">A1307</a>(M), leading primarily to Huntingdon. Depending on the scale of the ongoing development at <a href="http://www.alconbury-weald.co.uk/">Alconbury Weald</a>, its terminus may eventually become the outskirts of Huntingdon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://carto.metro.free.fr/cartes/metro-tram-london/">This is a really cool map</a>, showing the full geographically accurate (as far as I can tell) track layout of all railways and tramways in London. London Underground, London Overground and closed railways are all included, as is Tramlink in South London. Also included are the start and end of tunnels and the location and layout of depots and sidings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t feature any old tram lines or anything that was proposed but abandoned, even if building work had started (e.g. the Northern Line extension to Bushey Heath). However, it does include lines currently under construction (e.g. Crossrail) and that have not yet been started (e.g. the Northern Line extension to Battersea).</p>
<p>From the map you can get a real sense of where the railway capacity is in London as well as where stations, minor branch lines and useful non-radial links have been lost. The additional diagrams of historic track and junction layouts are particularly interesting. I am surprised and impressed that someone managed to find all of this information!</p>
<p>There are maps for additional cities and regions available too, from a drop-down menu above the map. I&#8217;d like to see Dublin&#8217;s railways, Luas and DART on a similar map.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I have been busy doing recently was <a href="http://www.student-parliaments.eu/local-parliaments-2013-14/local-student-parliaments/cambridge.html">a talk for the University of Cambridge about &#8216;Future Mobility&#8217;</a> at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/public-engagement/news/debate-science-european-student-parliament">the European Student Science Parliament held there</a>. Specifically, I was talking as an expert (due to my work building up to and resulting in <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409">Cambridge Automated Metro</a>) about the future of sustainable transport options in cities with historic cores, like Cambridge. This was my third time giving a talk like this, and I quite enjoyed it. Like <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1081">the blog post that preceded Cambridge Automated Metro</a>, it&#8217;s fun to have an excuse to research one&#8217;s ideas further and wrap up the results into a good summary. A talk is a particularly good format to convey this summary in, as it can be adjusted to suit the audience and feedback from the audience is normally genuine and useful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The website of the month for October 2013 is <a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/">A view from the cycle path</a>. The website seems to be primarily about cycling as a means of transportation but also has <a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2013/02/exaggeration-considered-harmful-hiding.html">some posts</a> specific to <a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2011/11/truth-about-cambridge.html">the problem of cycling in Cambridge</a>. It explores issues such as the exaggeration of cycling levels in Cambridge as well as the fact that many cycle due to various restrictions and issues with other forms of transport in the city rather than because they would otherwise freely choose to. I feel that the local councils could do with reminding of these and other facts as they proceed to waste <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Cyclists-concern-over-900k-junction-revamp-05032013.htm">large sums of money</a> on &#8220;pro-cycling&#8221; schemes that are of <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Cyclist-fights-for-life-after-two-riders-in-collision-at-revamped-safety-junction-in-Cambridge-20131005102516.htm">little benefit</a> <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Two-cyclists-in-serious-condition-today-after-crash-at-safety-junction-in-Cambridge-20131007132830.htm">to anyone</a>. As I highlighted during media coverage of Cambridge Automated Metro, I&#8217;m that a large chunk of the new large &#8220;city deal&#8221; transport budget will be spent on previously unheard of amounts of red paint for cycle lanes on roads that are too small in a city with no alternative transport conduits.</p>
<p>This month I am also highlighting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FinnMcDonald?feature=watch">the Finn McDonald YouTube channel</a> on which one can find (a decreasing number of) long YouTube videos containing the music produced in soundtrack recording sessions, including <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1466">my favourite music</a>. A number of films with good soundtracks are covered by the channel.</p>
<p>In other news I remain quite busy but I have recently finished off and scheduled a few posts that I started many months ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month&#8217;s <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409">Cambridge Automated Metro</a> post got quite a reaction. Beyond the tens of comments on this blog, it made pages <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151527196383924&#038;l=acfc1271da">1</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151527197678924&#038;l=ac2d84a9fc">2</a> of <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Docklands-Light-Railway-style-underground-system-proposed-for-Cambridge-20130618060000.htm">Cambridge News</a>, was reported on by <a href="http://vimeo.com/68710138">ITV News Anglia</a> and got me an interview with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p019rdtr">BBC Radio Cambridgeshire</a>. The proposal has certainly inspired some debate and thoughts, which was good to see. Below are my reactions to the coverage and your feedback.</p>
<p>Firstly, I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who has added their thoughts to the debate as, encouragingly, the vast majority of responses have been constructive. I had anticipated a more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">NIMBYish</a> response sprinkled with some vague engineering concerns &#8211; this is the response that proposals for tunnels under Cambridge have been countered with <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Professor-says-tunnels-vital-to-save-citys-historic-centre-11022013.htm">in the past</a>.<br />
<span id="more-1659"></span><br />
In terms of this proposal, it has become clear that reaching towns, villages and even cities in Cambridge&#8217;s hinterland is important to many people. After all, restricted residential development in Cambridge has pushed many people out into the surrounding area &#8211; the city has over 40,000 commuters. Cost was also an issue for many and there were concerns about the ability of local politicians to make such a project successful. I see that the construction delays, cost overruns and other problems with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire_Guided_Busway">Guided Busway</a> (which, after 5 years in Cambridge, I have still neither used nor met anyone with a use for it) haunts many. Personally I am of the opinion that the Guided Busway is only a stopgap unless it eventually provides routes in a variety of directions and, most importantly, isn&#8217;t as slow as every other method of transport once it&#8217;s within Cambridge.</p>
<p>The radio and newspaper coverage was pleasing, but the TV coverage was less so. I would like to point out that the people asked about the proposal shared several properties which means they&#8217;re not in a target demographic:</p>
<ol>
<li>They have time to visit central Cambridge on a weekday afternoon. <i>(Unlikely to be commuters).</i></li>
<li>They&#8217;re lucky enough to have not been caused enough grief by the current transport system to avoid their trip to central Cambridge. <i>(The lucky few, or they live in central Cambridge).</i></li>
<li>They have time to chat and are therefore unlikely to be paying the extortionate parking fees (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-22905334">or they&#8217;ve accepted a cheaper fine</a>). <i>(Unlikely to be drivers).</i></li>
<li>They were concerned enough to give a response. <i>(Unlikely to be tourists).</i></li>
</ol>
<p>The Cambridge Automated Metro, like most rapid transit systems, would be most useful for commuters. It would also, again like many other systems, be useful for tourists and visitors to the city. Additionally, as highlighted by one of the videos linked to above, it could be handy for families who are priced out of parking and for whom cycling is not a sensible option. All of these are sizable groups and catering for them properly would only increase their numbers. For others it is simply a convenience, though it might also take the pressure off the cost of accommodation in Cambridge by increasing the distance one can live from it while still availing of its benefits.</p>
<p>Later this year I hope to find the time to look into the issues and information highlighted by the feedback and produce a map of how such a system might look by 2050. The existing proposal only tested the water for inter-settlement transit with the Central line running to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northstowe">Northstowe</a>. I aim to propose specifically where in Cambridge any underground, surface level and above-ground tracks could run. This would be accompanied by well-reasoned track section cost estimates and I&#8217;ll try to calculate some passenger numbers (at the very least, the total pool of potential passengers). Obviously it would help to have a range of information about the existing situation if anyone has any, including additional figures such as the number of people using each existing form of transport, the amounts spent on transport, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following on from <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1081">a post back in February</a>, I had a brief go at imagining what an underground light rail system for Cambridge would look like (after all, <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Cambridge-politicians-are-failing-city-business-20130326122218.htm">Cambridge needs a bit more political ambition and vision</a>). Maybe, with <a href="http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/CMSWebsite/Apps/News/Details.aspx?ref=1016">at least £1billion potentially being unlocked soon for transport in the Greater Cambridge area</a>, something like this could be implemented &#8211; I certainly hope that it at least generates debate about the sorely needed transport investment in and around the city. While I haven&#8217;t done all of the analyses that I&#8217;d like (I&#8217;m not getting paid for this, unsurprisingly), I have tried to connect up a number of the hotspots highlighted on the map <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Tunnel-vision-to-keep-city-on-the-move-31012013.htm">here</a> with key transport links, attempted to avoid historic buildings (points at which the Cam can be crossed are somewhat limited by this) and given some thought to splitting the project into lines which also represent key stages. As noted on the proposal summary below, I have assumed a deep-level system &#8211; a cut-and-cover system would add the additional constraint of generally following roads.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1647" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409/cambridge-automated-metro" rel="attachment wp-att-1647"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1647" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cambridge-Automated-Metro-1024x576.png" alt="Cambridge Automated Metro Proposal" width="584" height="328" class="size-large wp-image-1647" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cambridge-Automated-Metro-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cambridge-Automated-Metro-300x168.png 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cambridge-Automated-Metro-500x281.png 500w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cambridge-Automated-Metro.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1647" class="wp-caption-text">What an underground <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docklands_Light_Railway">DLR</a>-style railway for Cambridge might look like.</p></div><span id="more-1409"></span>One small annoyance I have with the proposal above was the inability to serve Cambridge Retail Park and the Beehive Centre while also serving central Cambridge (Petersfield, Kite and Midsummer Common &#8211; sites, you&#8217;ll notice, where there is considerable green space and/or buildings that won&#8217;t be missed, so stations can be built) without doing a couple of sharp turns. I think there is less of an economic or mid-term case for a east-west line through the city centre (I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much development planned on this axis), but there are still a few plausible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-route the &#8216;Central&#8217; and &#8216;South&#8217; lines so that the &#8216;Central&#8217; line serves (after Chesterton) Cambridge Retail Park and the Beehive Centre before proceeding to Cambridge Station, Addenbrooke&#8217;s and Trumpington while the &#8216;South&#8217; line serves (after Cherry Hinton) Cambridge Station and Petersfield before terminating at Kite.</li>
<li>Following on from the previous option, there would also be potential to have the &#8216;South&#8217; line terminus further west near or in Lion Yard, the Grand Arcade or Cambridge University&#8217;s New Museums Site (which will <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Development-plans-for-central-Cambridge-University-sites-20130402060000.htm">soon be undergoing redevelopment</a>).</li>
<li>The modified &#8216;South&#8217; line could go further west still before terminating, with the line crossing the Cam not far from The Fen Causeway (avoiding the colleges to the North of this) so that it can serve the Newtown, Mill Pond and/or Newnham areas and/or Cambridge University&#8217;s Sidgwick Site, before possibly meeting the North Line at West Cambridge.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposal detailed in the map would be structurally closest to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rapid_transit&#038;oldid=550074383#Network_types">X-system</a> whereas the alternative detailed textually would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rapid_transit&#038;oldid=550074383#Network_types">Secant-system</a> &#8211; the cities in which these can be found would suggest that the former is more suitable for a city and metropolitan area of Cambridge&#8217;s size and structure.</p>
<p>Back-of-an-envelope calculations suggest that the number of stations envisaged should provide a London-like ratio of population to stations, ensuring financial viability. Obviously the city deal that Cambridge may get would significantly help with funding the constuction but there are other methods of raising money, depending on how much is needed and how aggressively adoption of the system is to be pushed. One aggressive solution for the phases depicted could involve city-wide parking restrictions that penalize overnight parking to ensure that the beneficiaries (residents of the city) are incentivised to use the system (residents who want a car for travel within Cambridge should put a garage-like facility higher up their list of priorities and those who need to travel by car outside of Cambridge could use the Park and Ride car parks for overnight parking). Further phases, to nearby towns and villages, could be funded via a city-wide congestion charge. However, if such an anti-car philosophy is being followed, it might be cheaper to simply convert most of Cambridge&#8217;s main roads into a tram-like surface-level light rail system, leaving enough roads for access (residential, commercial and emergency).</p>
<p>In the image below I&#8217;ve tried to envision what a smart card for the Cambridge Automated Metro (the equivalent of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_card">Oyster Card</a>) would look like. It uses the colours I&#8217;ve given the lines, to maintain a consistent look. It took a while to make the card not look too flag-like!</p>

<p>Finally, have you noticed the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a> that this website has had for the last few months? I updated it from the <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cam/">LocaMsg</a> icon when I was doing early work on the Cambridge Automated Metro idea, coming up with logo symbol designs. The logos used in the images above, the favicon and a few more designs can be found in the image below.</p>
