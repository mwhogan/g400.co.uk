										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently stumbled across <a href="http://www.cambridge-connect.uk/">the website of Cambridge Connect</a>, an initiative &#8220;to help create an enduring system of rapid and sustainable transit that would help address the transport challenges facing Cambridge, while ensuring that the social, educational, economic, environmental, historic and cultural qualities that define the City are maintained and enhanced&#8221;. So far the energies of Cambridge Connect seem to have been mostly spent investigating and proposing a light rail rapid transit system for Cambridge, something that I agree needs to be pursued as a long-term transport solution for the city and surrounding areas. It&#8217;s also probably a good time to propose the idea again because, as I initially feared, it looks like Cambridge&#8217;s city deal money is almost certainly going to be mostly spent on relatively piecemeal improvements that make Cambridge a less attractive place to live for most people.</p>

<p><span id="more-2175"></span>When initially looking through the Cambridge Connect website, and after having already decided to post about it, I was pleased to notice that <a href="http://www.cambridge-connect.uk/background/">it talks a little</a> about <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409">my Cambridge Automated Metro (CAM) proposal</a>. Indeed, a number of the ideas are preserved: <a href="http://www.cambridge-connect.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CambridgeConnect_NewtonLine_v5.0.jpg">the proposed Isaac Newton line</a> has some similarities to parts of all of CAM&#8217;s lines and some of CAM&#8217;s proposed extensions (though it cuts a corner by going directly under the historic city centre), and <a href="http://www.cambridge-connect.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CambridgeConnect_NewtonLine_ExtensionABC_v5.0.pdf">extensions A and B</a> connect many of the other areas covered by CAM. The idea of a main line and various extensions is also similar to CAM&#8217;s division into three lines that could be built at separate times.</p>
<p>While the initial CAM proposal was primarily an attempt to stoke imaginations and ambition while generating debate, Cambridge Connect does not mention the small amount of headway I made in <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1659">a later post</a> with thoughts on how to make the idea less financially infeasible:</p>
<blockquote><p>By skirting around the edge of the city to the south and north-west, the North and South lines could have significant ground-level sections, reducing costs. Additional complexity-reducing and cost-cutting measures could include the Chesterton to Cambridge Science Park section of the North line making use of Stourbridge Common for a cut-and-cover section and runing at ground level parallel to the train line when it meets that.</p></blockquote>
<p>It looks those behind Cambridge Connect had similar thoughts though, as their Isaac Newton line proposal does feature ground-level running to the south and north-west of Cambridge. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Overall, while I do quite like some of the unique elements of my CAM proposal (e.g. that it is an X-system rather than something more like a Secant-system), I am pleased to see a similar proposal that has benefited from having far more time and effort poured into it. I do hope that it will result in more concrete action and take Cambridge closer to having public transport that isn&#8217;t so bad that it drives people to cycling. Maybe someday I&#8217;ll get round to investigating CAM&#8217;s extensions further and proposing <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1890">Cambridge Countryside City</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remaining with the recently mentioned subject of <a href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/a14-cambridge-to-huntingdon-improvement-scheme/">the soon to start A14 upgrade</a> between Cambridge and Huntingdon (technically Milton to Ellington), I recently stumbled across <a href="http://www.pathetic.org.uk/secretive/a14m/">an entry about the A14(M)</a> on an interesting website called <a href="http://www.pathetic.org.uk/">Pathetic Motorways</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2160"></span>Pathetic Motorways aims to research, document and photograph a range of odd motorways, from those that were never (or only partially) built and those that have been renumbered to those that have been lost (through downgrade or abandonment) and those that are very short (i.e. &#8220;pathetic&#8221;). It certainly helps to explain some of the strange features of the motorways around today. London&#8217;s Ringways project, a significant feature on Pathetic Motorways, has been <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/100">covered here before</a>.</p>
<p>The A14(M) has an interesting history, explained fully on Pathetic Motorways. However, it also has an interesting future. A brief glance through <a href="http://assets.highways.gov.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/roads/road-projects/a14-cambridge-to-huntingdon-improvement/A14_s56%20Plan_ES%20Figure%201.1%20Site%20Location%20and%20Context.pdf">the detailed A14 upgrade maps</a> (I pity anyone who has to read through the vast quantity of accompanying documentation) suggests that the small and secretive A14(M) will remain after the impending upgrade, <a href="http://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/TR010018/2.%20Post-Submission/Application%20Documents/Drawings/A14%202.10%20Traffic%20Regulation%20Measures%20Plan-SLP-Sheet%2028%20of%2029.pdf">possibly becoming</a> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1307_road">A1307</a>(M), leading primarily to Huntingdon. Depending on the scale of the ongoing development at <a href="http://www.alconbury-weald.co.uk/">Alconbury Weald</a>, its terminus may eventually become the outskirts of Huntingdon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hcrfm.co.uk/">Huntingdon Community Radio</a> is a useful radio station to listen to when using the <a href="http://www.huntspost.co.uk/news/approved_government_backs_1_8billion_a14_huntingdon_to_cambridge_upgrade_1_4531313">soon to be upgraded</a> section of the A14 between Cambridge and Huntingdon (though the signal is a bit weak beyond Bar Hill). As well as playing one of the best ranges of music that I&#8217;ve heard on radio, it provides detailed information on the roads and rails around Huntingdon. However, until recently, I was puzzled by a daily occurrence on the radio station that was never announced nor acknowledged.</p>
<p><span id="more-2149"></span>At 6:58 every morning, as the overnight playlist comes to an end, one particular piece of music is played without fail. It sounds pretty cool to me and, after months of wondering what it was, <a href="https://twitter.com/g400_pub/status/720489175435317249">I asked</a>: it&#8217;s &#8220;Listen To Essex&#8221;, which <a href="http://www.45cat.com/record/7p227uk">seems to be</a> by <a href="http://davidarnoldmusic.com/">David Arnold</a> (no, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Arnold">this David Arnold</a>). Originally the Essex Radio theme music in the early 1980s, it seems to be living on in Huntingdonshire. Have a listen to it yourself and see what you think. There&#8217;s a recording of decent quality <a href="http://www.radioandtelly.co.uk/essexradioaudio.html">here</a>, or a lower quality version embedded below.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have noticed over the last few years, since becoming Cantabits the image at the top of this blog rapidly evolved into a monthly image of a particular tree near Cambridge. As the seasons changed, so did the image. Recently, I decided that it was time for a change &#8211; since December 2013 I&#8217;ve been uploading different images. Already, with photos of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire_Guided_Busway">the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_Main_Line">the East Coast Main Line</a> and a road leading into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetford_Forest">Thetford Forest</a>, a transport theme seems to have emerged. However, I expect this to evolve further over time and there&#8217;s no longer a need to keep updating the image regularly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I have been busy doing recently was <a href="http://www.student-parliaments.eu/local-parliaments-2013-14/local-student-parliaments/cambridge.html">a talk for the University of Cambridge about &#8216;Future Mobility&#8217;</a> at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/public-engagement/news/debate-science-european-student-parliament">the European Student Science Parliament held there</a>. Specifically, I was talking as an expert (due to my work building up to and resulting in <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409">Cambridge Automated Metro</a>) about the future of sustainable transport options in cities with historic cores, like Cambridge. This was my third time giving a talk like this, and I quite enjoyed it. Like <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1081">the blog post that preceded Cambridge Automated Metro</a>, it&#8217;s fun to have an excuse to research one&#8217;s ideas further and wrap up the results into a good summary. A talk is a particularly good format to convey this summary in, as it can be adjusted to suit the audience and feedback from the audience is normally genuine and useful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The website of the month for October 2013 is <a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/">A view from the cycle path</a>. The website seems to be primarily about cycling as a means of transportation but also has <a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2013/02/exaggeration-considered-harmful-hiding.html">some posts</a> specific to <a href="http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2011/11/truth-about-cambridge.html">the problem of cycling in Cambridge</a>. It explores issues such as the exaggeration of cycling levels in Cambridge as well as the fact that many cycle due to various restrictions and issues with other forms of transport in the city rather than because they would otherwise freely choose to. I feel that the local councils could do with reminding of these and other facts as they proceed to waste <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Cyclists-concern-over-900k-junction-revamp-05032013.htm">large sums of money</a> on &#8220;pro-cycling&#8221; schemes that are of <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Cyclist-fights-for-life-after-two-riders-in-collision-at-revamped-safety-junction-in-Cambridge-20131005102516.htm">little benefit</a> <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Two-cyclists-in-serious-condition-today-after-crash-at-safety-junction-in-Cambridge-20131007132830.htm">to anyone</a>. As I highlighted during media coverage of Cambridge Automated Metro, I&#8217;m that a large chunk of the new large &#8220;city deal&#8221; transport budget will be spent on previously unheard of amounts of red paint for cycle lanes on roads that are too small in a city with no alternative transport conduits.</p>
<p>This month I am also highlighting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FinnMcDonald?feature=watch">the Finn McDonald YouTube channel</a> on which one can find (a decreasing number of) long YouTube videos containing the music produced in soundtrack recording sessions, including <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1466">my favourite music</a>. A number of films with good soundtracks are covered by the channel.</p>
<p>In other news I remain quite busy but I have recently finished off and scheduled a few posts that I started many months ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month&#8217;s <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409">Cambridge Automated Metro</a> post got quite a reaction. Beyond the tens of comments on this blog, it made pages <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151527196383924&#038;l=acfc1271da">1</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151527197678924&#038;l=ac2d84a9fc">2</a> of <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Docklands-Light-Railway-style-underground-system-proposed-for-Cambridge-20130618060000.htm">Cambridge News</a>, was reported on by <a href="http://vimeo.com/68710138">ITV News Anglia</a> and got me an interview with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p019rdtr">BBC Radio Cambridgeshire</a>. The proposal has certainly inspired some debate and thoughts, which was good to see. Below are my reactions to the coverage and your feedback.</p>
<p>Firstly, I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who has added their thoughts to the debate as, encouragingly, the vast majority of responses have been constructive. I had anticipated a more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">NIMBYish</a> response sprinkled with some vague engineering concerns &#8211; this is the response that proposals for tunnels under Cambridge have been countered with <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Professor-says-tunnels-vital-to-save-citys-historic-centre-11022013.htm">in the past</a>.<br />
<span id="more-1659"></span><br />
In terms of this proposal, it has become clear that reaching towns, villages and even cities in Cambridge&#8217;s hinterland is important to many people. After all, restricted residential development in Cambridge has pushed many people out into the surrounding area &#8211; the city has over 40,000 commuters. Cost was also an issue for many and there were concerns about the ability of local politicians to make such a project successful. I see that the construction delays, cost overruns and other problems with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire_Guided_Busway">Guided Busway</a> (which, after 5 years in Cambridge, I have still neither used nor met anyone with a use for it) haunts many. Personally I am of the opinion that the Guided Busway is only a stopgap unless it eventually provides routes in a variety of directions and, most importantly, isn&#8217;t as slow as every other method of transport once it&#8217;s within Cambridge.</p>
<p>The radio and newspaper coverage was pleasing, but the TV coverage was less so. I would like to point out that the people asked about the proposal shared several properties which means they&#8217;re not in a target demographic:</p>
<ol>
<li>They have time to visit central Cambridge on a weekday afternoon. <i>(Unlikely to be commuters).</i></li>
<li>They&#8217;re lucky enough to have not been caused enough grief by the current transport system to avoid their trip to central Cambridge. <i>(The lucky few, or they live in central Cambridge).</i></li>
<li>They have time to chat and are therefore unlikely to be paying the extortionate parking fees (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-22905334">or they&#8217;ve accepted a cheaper fine</a>). <i>(Unlikely to be drivers).</i></li>
<li>They were concerned enough to give a response. <i>(Unlikely to be tourists).</i></li>
</ol>
<p>The Cambridge Automated Metro, like most rapid transit systems, would be most useful for commuters. It would also, again like many other systems, be useful for tourists and visitors to the city. Additionally, as highlighted by one of the videos linked to above, it could be handy for families who are priced out of parking and for whom cycling is not a sensible option. All of these are sizable groups and catering for them properly would only increase their numbers. For others it is simply a convenience, though it might also take the pressure off the cost of accommodation in Cambridge by increasing the distance one can live from it while still availing of its benefits.</p>
<p>Later this year I hope to find the time to look into the issues and information highlighted by the feedback and produce a map of how such a system might look by 2050. The existing proposal only tested the water for inter-settlement transit with the Central line running to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northstowe">Northstowe</a>. I aim to propose specifically where in Cambridge any underground, surface level and above-ground tracks could run. This would be accompanied by well-reasoned track section cost estimates and I&#8217;ll try to calculate some passenger numbers (at the very least, the total pool of potential passengers). Obviously it would help to have a range of information about the existing situation if anyone has any, including additional figures such as the number of people using each existing form of transport, the amounts spent on transport, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To celebrate the summer, the website of the month for August 2013 is <a href="http://www.tikibrand.com/">TIKI Brand</a> &#8211; a cool website that sells trendy-looking outdoor torches, lamps and candles to help you create &#8220;paradise in your backyard&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also like to highlight <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/">The Centre for Computing History</a>, which has been <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/622">previously mentioned on this blog</a>. Apparently the necessary funding for a move to Cambridge was acquired and it opened <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/pages/28568/Visiting/">near Cambridge Retail Park and The Beehive Centre</a> on Saturday (the 27th of July).<br />
<div id="attachment_1802" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1667/the-centre-for-computing-history" rel="attachment wp-att-1802"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1802" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Centre-for-Computing-History-300x132.jpg" alt="The Centre for Computing History" width="300" height="132" class="size-medium wp-image-1802" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Centre-for-Computing-History-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Centre-for-Computing-History-500x220.jpg 500w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Centre-for-Computing-History.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1802" class="wp-caption-text">The Centre for Computing History</p></div><br />
The centre contains an interesting range of computers, some of which you will not have seen for many years and others you may not have seen in person at all! There are also many games consoles and most of the machines seem to be in good working order and powered on for you to have fun with or re-acquaint yourself with. A number of displays give plenty of information, from a brief history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers">Acorn</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad">Amstrad</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Research">Sinclair</a> to amusing famous quotes about computers from their early days. Tickets are half price until later in the year while they get all of the displays fully up and running, but there was already plenty there to do on Saturday.</p>
