I think I&#039;ve been desensitised to the gimmicks - I don&#039;t notice them unless a point is made of them (e.g. in Pirates 4, Blackbeard pointing his sword out of the screen and Angelica&#039;s sword coming through a door towards the audience). I agree about the wide shots - they look amazing if you ignore foreground branches! Personally I was much more bothered by the cinematography in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/849&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Les Misérables&lt;/a&gt;, where I think they overused close-ups to make sure they emotionally engaged the audience. I think they were afraid to stray too far from the stage production, which is less able to realistically convey locales and scale.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was rather disappointed with the cinematography. HFR=good, 3D=good, 4k=good, but way too many 3D gimmicks (objects flying towards the viewer and other things that make 3D sickening).

Wide pan shots are cool, and esp. in the Shire work really well in 3D/HFR/4K, then Mr Jackson spoils it all by putting a tree branch too close!

Some great running shots of Dwarfs running in caves, monsters in chase, SPOILT by arrows needlessly being fired at the audience!

The technology is good, and I would love to see more of it, just stop pretending we&#039;re in the 1950s.]]></description>
