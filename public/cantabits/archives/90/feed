					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/90#comment-26&quot;&gt;Orval&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m not sure if that was said sarcastically or seriously. I linked some terms to explanatory content and explained some of the real-world advantages and disadvantages of various components found in the phones mentioned. Other things are easily learned about via resources such as Wikipedia. It would be unrealistic for me (and largely a waste of time) to find and link good related content for every term that had reasonable potential to not be understood. Regardless of your meaning, thanks for taking the time to comment with feedback. :)]]></description>
