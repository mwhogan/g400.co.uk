You miss my point - corporate branding makes complete sense. The similarities highlighted above are independent of the brands - they&#039;re related to the operating system on the device. HTC is a good example as it appears in two of the images: while the items included on the front and rear of their devices are similar in location and nature (e.g. HTC logo, Beats Audio logo, speaker grilles, three buttons below the screen, etc.), the device colours, sizes and shapes match far more closely with other devices with the same operating system (the Nokia and Samsung in the examples above) than with each other.

Apple is, in a sense, a non-example as it is the only maker of iOS devices, though it still fits the pattern as its devices are substantially different to those of its competitors.]]></description>

I think that is called &quot;Corporate branding&quot;. If you have a successful product why change? Make the new model incorporate the popular items in the old model and build upon there strengths. Forget anything that was unpopular or didn&#039;t work well... You raise the idea of the iPhone/iPad/iPod I think the reason for the similarities is the idea that the iPod is seen as a quality design (haven&#039;t got one myself by the way!). What better way to market it than to associate it with an already successful model selling in the millions. See cars as another example Fords whole range have similarly designed front ends.]]></description>

What I was alluding to, but didn&#039;t have enough characters in the tweet to explain, was that the operating system seems to imply a lot of a device&#039;s aesthetics beyond those related to functionality. The Windows Phone 8 designs are perhaps the most explainable, with the phones mimicking the brightly coloured rectangles (it is somewhat disappointing to see such convergence). However, why the leading Android devices are white with straight sides, similar convex rear designs, curved tops and bottoms, three buttons below the screens and horizontally centred but vertically high main cameras (amongst other similarities), is less clear. The iPhones fit the pattern too though, as you rightly point out, that&#039;s primarily for different reasons. However, it is notable that Apple didn&#039;t have to make the iPad and iPod Touch as similar to the iPhone as they are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are some similarities but that&#039;s what design is about isn&#039;t it? Eventually it evolves into the accepted norm which most people are happy with and unpopular designs are forgotten about. The last example isn&#039;t really a surprise! Both made by Apple, not really a redesign at all, just new insides and software really... But then why would they bother redesigning something that works and sells in the millions?

For an example going back further in time look at Porsche hardly changed (in looks) since it started - still going strong!]]></description>
