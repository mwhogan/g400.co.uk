It is very much a continuation of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.g400.co.uk\/blog\/\">my old blog<\/a>, but hopefully with some improvements. Below are some related questions that you may want the answers to. I hope that you find this blog interesting and\/or of some use.<\/p>\n<p>Various improvements (e.g. theming, plugins, etc.) will come in time.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cantawhat?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cantabits has four intended roots\/meanings.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cantab\">Cantab<\/a> refers to members of the University of Cambridge, residents of Cambridge and the suffix indicating a degree from the University of Cambridge. Bits refers to the nature of blog posts (bits &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/bencord0.wordpress.com\/\">fragments<\/a>, some might say &#8211; of information on the Internet). <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bit\">Bits<\/a> also refers to the literal nature of these posts and my knowledge, experience and pursuit of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Computer_science\">computer science<\/a>. Finally, and slightly accidentally, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/cantabit\">cantabit<\/a> is the third-person singular future active indicative of canto which, deriving all of the way back from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Proto-Indo-European_language\">Proto-Indo-European<\/a>, is the Latin verb &#8220;to sing&#8221;. This reflects my knowledge, experience and pursuit of music and music technology, recently culminating in a project, dissertation and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Android_(operating_system)\">Android<\/a> application investigating and demonstrating ad-hoc acoustic networking between phones.<\/p>\n<p>Why did I give the blog a name, rather than just call it Mark&#8217;s Blog (like the previous incarnation)? The idea occurred to me when planning the details of what was going to happen to my older blog. Essentially, it is a much better idea to leave my blog where it is which, unfortunately, means that I can&#8217;t reuse g400.co.uk\/blog.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Is anything going to be different?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The name (see the question above for more information).<\/p>\n<p>Now that WordPress is taking care of the hard work, hopefully there will be richer content in posts and more frequent posts. Comments will probably have to be approved by me and I hope to integrate things like my public Twitter account into the blog in a less separate way.<\/p>\n<p>The subjects covered by the blog will not be changed significantly (the website of the month will stay, for example), and will continue to drift with my interests (and the interests of the admins). On the subject of admins, I&#8217;m happy to re-add any of the old admins but will not do so by default as there&#8217;s probably some overhead to that and they haven&#8217;t posted in a long time.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, unlike my old blog, this one will not necessarily have valid <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/XHTML\">XHTML<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cascading_Style_Sheets\">CSS<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/RSS\">RSS<\/a>. But I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll get over that.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Why a new blog?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Two reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Writing your own blog software as well as posting to and maintaining the blog contents itself is very time-consuming when you&#8217;re doing it in addition to work, school or university, and life. Consequently the first reason is time. While I did have the time to write the code powering my old blog, I concentrated on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.g400.co.uk\/cam\/\">university work<\/a> at university and am now devoting all of my coding time and effort to my job.<\/p>\n<p>Writing a comments system around <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blosxom.com\/\">simple but unusual blog software<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0then replacing that software with your own, keeping the same comments system, does not lead to well-designed software. All of this was also done in languages I had no prior experience of. Consequently the second reason is the need for the code powering my old blog to be <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Code_refactoring\">refactored<\/a> in order to significantly change the design and add features, to keep it up-to-date.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8230;the latest incarnation of my blog.
