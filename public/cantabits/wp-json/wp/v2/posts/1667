There are also many games consoles and most of the machines seem to be in good working order and powered on for you to have fun with or re-acquaint yourself with. A number of displays give plenty of information, from a brief history of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Acorn_Computers\">Acorn<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Amstrad\">Amstrad<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sinclair_Research\">Sinclair<\/a> to amusing famous quotes about computers from their early days. Tickets are half price until later in the year while they get all of the displays fully up and running, but there was already plenty there to do on Saturday.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To celebrate the summer, the website of the month for August 2013 is TIKI Brand &#8211; a cool website that sells trendy-looking outdoor torches, lamps and candles to help you create &#8220;paradise in your backyard&#8221;.
