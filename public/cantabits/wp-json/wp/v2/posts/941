Personally, I think it&#8217;s a significant improvement in the viewing experience &#8211; perhaps even more so than 3D. In HFR, the Hobbit looks more like it is really happening in front of you, with people and objects looking more like they do in real life. The downside of this is that, if you&#8217;re looking for it, you can see the artificialness of the sets and props much more easily &#8211; I didn&#8217;t find this a distraction, however, as I spent the majority of the film just watching and enjoying it rather than in a critic&#8217;s frame of mind. Overall, the film obviously has significant similarities with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)\">The Lord of the Rings trilogy<\/a>, though sufficient differences to perhaps make it more interesting to those who are reluctant to watch it. For example, as the main characters in the film generally stay together, more can actually happen in the film as many different groups don&#8217;t have to be followed at once. Also, being one book spread out over three films, there&#8217;s more time for comedy. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Martin_Freeman\">Martin Freeman<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richard_Armitage_(actor)\">Richard Armitage<\/a> both handle their leading roles in the film well &#8211; the latter previously starred in things such as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Robin_Hood_(2006_TV_series)\">the BBC&#8217;s recent Robin Hood TV series<\/a>, some of the soundtrack of which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.g400.co.uk\/blog\/pl\/music\/nice_music_july_2009\">was previously featured on this blog<\/a>. Predictably, the soundtrack of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is good too. It was written, like the soundtrack for The Lord of the Rings, by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Howard_Shore\">Howard Shore<\/a>.
