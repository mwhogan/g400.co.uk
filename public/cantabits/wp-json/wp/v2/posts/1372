Currently, it demonstrates the crippling situation for people who don&#8217;t already own property and\/or who lack large sums of money &#8211; the prices and trends in Cambridge make property prices in the rest of the UK (in which it is still very difficult to buy property) look almost pleasant. I wish they&#8217;d sort out the supply problem both locally and nationally.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, don&#8217;t forget <a href=\"http:\/\/theboatrace.org\/\">The Boat Race<\/a> next weekend!<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1402\" style=\"width: 594px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.g400.co.uk\/cantabits\/archives\/1372\/live-cambridge-poster\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1402\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1402\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/www.g400.co.uk\/cantabits\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Live-Cambridge-Poster-662x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Live Cambridge Poster\" width=\"584\" height=\"903\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1402\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.g400.co.uk\/cantabits\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Live-Cambridge-Poster-662x1024.jpg 662w, https:\/\/www.g400.co.uk\/cantabits\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Live-Cambridge-Poster-194x300.jpg 194w, https:\/\/www.g400.co.uk\/cantabits\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/Live-Cambridge-Poster.jpg 1840w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-1402\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some apps can be found by simply keeping your eyes open<\/p><\/div><br \/>\n<!--more--><strong>Live Cambridge, formerly WoNoW Cambridge (What&#8217;s On Now Cambridge)<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.livecambridge.co.uk\/\">Website<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.atlas_live.livecam\">Google Play<\/a><br \/>\nThis is a fantastic little app that brings together much of the information you need when in Cambridge from the time of the next bus or train to the what&#8217;s on at the cinemas and theatres.

The Cambridge Beer Festival app is a good tie-in, aiding exploration of the beers available in a meaningful and social way and providing a much more searchable and convenient list of the beers than the booklet given to attendees. I&#8217;d recommend the event to those who haven&#8217;t been (indeed, I&#8217;ve only had the time to attend since graduating) &#8211; it&#8217;s a good chance to sit and relax with friends on Jesus Green in the early summer and enjoy some of the surrounding environment and culture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cambridge Alumni<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.alumni.cam.ac.uk\">Website<\/a> &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=uk.ac.cam.alumni.cambridgealumni\">Google Play<\/a><br \/>\nA far more recent addition to the Android platform (a legacy from the era when apps were written with mainly in mind), the Cambridge Alumni app presents information such as news, research and events from <a href=\"www.alumni.cam.ac.uk\">the Cambridge Alumni website<\/a> in a form that&#8217;s much easier to digest on a mobile device than the website itself. However, with the recent mobile-friendly redesign of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cam.ac.uk\/\">the main University of Cambridge website<\/a>, for how long will the Cambridge Alumni Android app remain relevant?<\/p>\n<hr \/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li id=\"footnote_0_1372\" class=\"footnote\">The title is cheesy, isn&#8217;t it?
