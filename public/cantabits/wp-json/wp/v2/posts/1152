I find the post particularly interesting though, as implied by the &#8220;Future&#8221; section, there&#8217;s a good deal more research that should be done in the area. I was amused to find that I&#8217;ve developed (or, more likely, inadvertently picked up) the memory-aid techniques detailed. I can&#8217;t help but wonder if it makes economic sense for the larger programmer-heavy organisations to invest in their own private research to increase the productivity of their staff.<\/p>\n<hr \/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li id=\"footnote_0_1152\" class=\"footnote\">Unlike my music posts, for example, where I stick to opinions and relating pieces of music rather than dissecting them more scientifically.
