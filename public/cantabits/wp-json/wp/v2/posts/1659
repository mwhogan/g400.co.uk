There&rsquo;s a shred of evidence here, from around the time I was interviewed, indicating my presence on the show.\">2<\/a><\/sup>. The proposal has certainly inspired some debate and thoughts, which was good to see. Below are my reactions to the coverage and your feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who has added their thoughts to the debate as, encouragingly, the vast majority of responses have been constructive. I had anticipated a more <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NIMBY\">NIMBYish<\/a> response sprinkled with some vague engineering concerns &#8211; this is the response that proposals for tunnels under Cambridge have been countered with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cambridge-news.co.uk\/News\/Professor-says-tunnels-vital-to-save-citys-historic-centre-11022013.htm\">in the past<\/a>.<br \/>\n<!--more--><br \/>\nIn terms of this proposal, it has become clear that reaching towns, villages and even cities in Cambridge&#8217;s hinterland is important to many people. After all, restricted residential development in Cambridge has pushed many people out into the surrounding area &#8211; the city has over 40,000<sup><a href=\"#footnote_2_1659\" id=\"identifier_2_1659\" class=\"footnote-link footnote-identifier-link\" title=\"Extrapolated from slightly old data.\">3<\/a><\/sup> commuters. Cost was also an issue for many and there were concerns about the ability of local politicians to make such a project successful. I see that the construction delays, cost overruns and other problems with the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cambridgeshire_Guided_Busway\">Guided Busway<\/a> (which, after 5 years in Cambridge, I have still neither used nor met anyone with a use for it<sup><a href=\"#footnote_3_1659\" id=\"identifier_3_1659\" class=\"footnote-link footnote-identifier-link\" title=\"I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s wonderful if you live a significant distance along the route and need to get into Cambridge, but this rather limits its scope.\">4<\/a><\/sup>) haunts many. Personally I am of the opinion that the Guided Busway is only a stopgap unless it eventually provides routes in a variety of directions and, most importantly, isn&#8217;t as slow as every other method of transport once it&#8217;s within Cambridge.<\/p>\n<p>The radio and newspaper coverage was pleasing, but the TV coverage was less so. I would like to point out that the people asked about the proposal shared several properties which means they&#8217;re not in a target demographic:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>They have time to visit central Cambridge on a weekday afternoon. <i>(Unlikely to be commuters).<\/i><\/li>\n<li>They&#8217;re lucky enough to have not been caused enough grief by the current transport system to avoid their trip to central Cambridge. <i>(The lucky few, or they live in central Cambridge).<\/i><\/li>\n<li>They have time to chat and are therefore unlikely to be paying the extortionate parking fees (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-cambridgeshire-22905334\">or they&#8217;ve accepted a cheaper fine<\/a>). <i>(Unlikely to be drivers).<\/i><\/li>\n<li>They were concerned enough to give a response. <i>(Unlikely to be tourists).<\/i><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The Cambridge Automated Metro, like most rapid transit systems, would be most useful for commuters. It would also, again like many other systems, be useful for tourists and visitors to the city. Additionally, as highlighted by one of the videos linked to above, it could be handy for families who are priced out of parking and for whom cycling is not a sensible option. All of these are sizable groups and catering for them properly would only increase their numbers. For others it is simply a convenience, though it might also take the pressure off the cost of accommodation in Cambridge by increasing the distance one can live from it while still availing of its benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Later this year<sup><a href=\"#footnote_4_1659\" id=\"identifier_4_1659\" class=\"footnote-link footnote-identifier-link\" title=\"I have very little time for additional activities and I am not experienced with planning transport infrastructure, so it will take time.\">5<\/a><\/sup> I hope to find the time to look into the issues and information highlighted by the feedback and produce a map of how such a system might look by 2050<sup><a href=\"#footnote_5_1659\" id=\"identifier_5_1659\" class=\"footnote-link footnote-identifier-link\" title=\"It would be preferable for a number of reasons not to build lines to everywhere at once.\">6<\/a><\/sup>. The existing proposal only tested the water for inter-settlement transit with the Central line running to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Northstowe\">Northstowe<\/a>.

Obviously it would help to have a range of information about the existing situation if anyone has any, including additional figures such as the number of people using each existing form of transport, the amounts spent on transport, etc.<\/p>\n<hr \/><ol class=\"footnotes\"><li id=\"footnote_0_1659\" class=\"footnote\">If anyone is a subscriber to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cambridge-news.co.uk\/News\/E-Edition.htm\">E-Edition of Cambridge News<\/a>, you may have enough information for me to link to a better image of the front page.
