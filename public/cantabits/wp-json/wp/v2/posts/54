Well, the wait is over: below are three websites for three months. Hopefully these posts should only be dependent on me actually finding good websites going forward as it&#8217;s easier than ever for me to post on this blog. For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.g400.co.uk\/cantabits\/archives\/53\">the previous post<\/a> came <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/g400_pub\/status\/115156967655346176\">from Twitter<\/a>\u00a0(in fact, I only tweeted it as a test :P).<\/p>\n<p><strong>July 2011<\/strong><br \/>\nI&#8217;ve been running an <a href=\"http:\/\/source.android.com\/\">AOSP<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.androidcentral.com\/dictionary#R\">ROM<\/a> on my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xda-developers.com\/android\/a-tribute-to-the-htc-hd2-part-one\/\">HD2<\/a> for some time now. Unfortunately, Android doesn&#8217;t actually support Windows Media Audio (a good format, BTW, in my opinion), and I eventually got round to converting my Windows Media Audio files to something more universally playable using some nice-looking, free and generally well-made software. Consequently, the website of the month for July is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wma-to-mp3.org\/wma-to-mp3-converter.html\">the website where this software can be found<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>August 2011<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtuberepeat.com\/\">YouTubeRepeat.com<\/a> is the website of the month for August 2011\u00a0for being simple, useful and easy-to-use. It also looks like it isn&#8217;t making any attempts to make money from advertising, which is both a nice gesture and probably legally wiser than attempting to do so.<\/p>\n<p><strong>September 2011<\/strong><br \/>\nSticking with the simplicity theme, <a href=\"http:\/\/mwahahahahahaha.com\/\">here&#8217;s another simple and useful website<\/a>.
