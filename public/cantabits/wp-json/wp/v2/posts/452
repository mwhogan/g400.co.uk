Apologies for the slight lateness of this post &#8211; this month has been and will continue to be unusually busy for me. However, I have built up a larger than usual range of links to share and have enough time to do them all reasonable justice. \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/deaddrops.com\/\">Dead Drops<\/a> is an interesting anonymous, offline, peer to peer file-sharing network consisting of USB flash drives are embedded into walls, buildings and curbs accessible to anybody in public space. The size of the network seems to be increasing at a good pace too, so keep an eye on it if there are none near you currently!<\/p>\n<p>You may have missed a few less-obvious bits of mobile news lately amongst the various announcements from Apple, HTC, Samsung, Sony and others. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/5\/4\/2998403\/apple-samsung-99-percent-profit-asymco\">Here are some fascinating illustrations<\/a> of which smartphone designers\/manufacturers are making money today and how this has been changing over the last 5 or so years. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/5\/11\/3013664\/lg-ls970-eclipse-4g-lte-quad-core-snapdragon-s4-rumor\">This is an interesting insight<\/a> into what those companies are cooking up for late 2012 and some of 2013. Hopefully we&#8217;ll see more software able to put the increasingly excessive power and speed to good use.<\/p>\n<p>Google recently produced <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/green\/storyofsend\/\">a friendly animation explaining the process of sending an email via Gmail<\/a> &#8211; potentially insightful if you don&#8217;t know how a lot of the magic of the Internet happens. It features landline broadband with a Wi-Fi router on one end and a cellular (mobile) network on the other end, which leads me to a piece of information the companies above should find interesting: the HTC HD2 is one of the most popular Android phones <a href=\"http:\/\/opensignalmaps.com\/reports\/fragmentation.php\">according to one study<\/a> (34th, if I&#8217;ve counted correctly), despite being shipped with a completely different operating system. Also, speaking of Android, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/5\/18\/3028202\/mk802-android-usb-hdmi-stick\">you can now get USB sticks that run Android increasingly cheaply<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I have a few links on broader research this month too: researchers at the MIT Media Lab <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/5\/13\/3018142\/zeron-mit-media-lab-levitation\">have been up to some pretty cool stuff with magnets<\/a>, Monmouth (in Wales) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/5\/17\/3026058\/monmouth-monmouthpedia-wikipedia-town\">has become the world&#8217;s first Wikipedia town<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/5\/17\/3026074\/starlite-maurice-ward-plastic-fireproof\">Starlite is a miracle material that could be lost forever<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mappinglife.org\/\">the Map of Life<\/a> brings together in an easily-usable way all types of information about species distribution to support the understanding and protection of the world&#8217;s biodiversity.<\/p>\n<p>In other news, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cambridge-news.co.uk\/Home\/Cambridge-University-Press-to-hand-over-printing-work-to-another-firm-06062012.htm\">Cambridge University Press, the world\u2019s oldest printing and publishing company<\/a>, is handing its printing business &#8211; it does make sense to print books closer to where they are needed, though there are many other other arguments for and against what is truly the end of an era. It was also nice to see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-northern-ireland-18328382\">the Olympic torch in Ireland<\/a>, you can view an informative and historically accurate recreation of the great pyramids from your browser <a href=\"http:\/\/giza3d.3ds.com\/\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.halproject.com\/\">this website<\/a> and the screensavers it hosts are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HwBmPiOmEGQ\">good<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I leave you with two nice tracks from the recently released Madagascar 3 soundtrack and news that I hope to do one or two further posts this week, but will then be too busy to post for a few weeks again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>New York City Surprise<\/strong><br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/DV4yPS0e0Rc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rescue Stefano<\/strong><br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-8IIK_Xgqw8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The website of the month for June 2012 is thou shalt not commit logical fallacies &#8211; a handy and good-looking website and creative commons licensed poster with quick explanations of a range of logical fallacies.
