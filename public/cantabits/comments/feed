					<description><![CDATA[Have you thought of researching the use of trolley buses in London, after the war (WW2)? They were in use on Green Lanes in the early to middle 1960s, if memory serves me correctly.

					<description><![CDATA[A tunnel is definitely feasible. About 20 years ago it was the chosen method of making a new main drain from Riverside to Milton - over 3km long, and none of it cut-and-cover. It&#039;s under or near (for example), Chesterton Recreation Ground, Scotland Road, Green End Road, and Green Park.

The drain is 2120mm diameter which is pretty big: not big enough for transport, but surprisingly close. I think around 2500mm diameter would be enough for the PRT system (*) serving Heathrow terminal 5. I&#039;ve been told that it could cost about 3 times as much per kilometre to put that system underground rather than overhead, which is acceptable where there&#039;s no choice but it does mean that overhead should be used where possible.

A constraint for a tunnel route is the need for lift shafts at the stations. My initial suggestion would be Railway Station, Gonville Place (under the car park?), Grand Arcade/Drummer Street (there&#039;s apparently already some provision for underground connectivity between them), Park Street (as part of the redevelopment of the car park), Adam&#038;Eve Street (for the Grafton area and Anglia Ruskin), Beehive, and back to the Station. It could do with another in the Mill Road area - perhaps in the development of the Council Depot site.

Whatever one thinks about the Guided Bus, I don&#039;t think it makes sense to duplicate it south of the railway station, but it does make sense to join the two sections. There should be scope for some of the northern part of the PRT system to be overhead, but the need to link it to the in-town section means that space has to be found for the transitions between under- and over-ground. Perhaps Park Street, Midsummer Common, Cheddars Lane (all underground), Stourbridge Common, Chesterton Station (transition at one of these), then Science Park, Regional College, Orchard Park, NIAB-site development, University NorthWest site (all overhead), Madingley Road park&#038;ride, University WestCam site (transition at one these), and back to Park Street. It could do with one in the Grange Road/Queens Road area but space might be difficult to find.

That&#039;s deliberately one clockwise loop and one anticlockwise loop: if each was one-way only (to save money!) then the worst case journey time might be around half an hour. I don&#039;t know how that compares with a bus ride, for example from the station to West Cam?

I do wonder if some of those people ever leave the city and see the rest of the world, or at least read the article they&#039;re commenting on. But, having read comments like that for years on CN, I am actually heartened by the number of constructive responses. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409#comment-124&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#039;s sad that, with the guided busway, the opportunity was missed to create a form of transport that wasn&#039;t affected by the poor road system in Cambridge. I think it would be worth running the numbers, as tens of thousands of people commute into Cambridge from all directions - a disproportionately large number compared to most places. I also wonder if such a system would allow companies to create more jobs due to changes in accommodation and transport arrangements and costs.

I would support a real cycle lane system (rather than just red-painted edges of roads) as a short term solution or part of a longer-term solution but the main routes in and out of Cambridge simply don&#039;t have enough width. It also doesn&#039;t help people with commutes too long to cycle - this group will increase in size as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-22949623&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the number of jobs in Cambridge increases&lt;/a&gt; and construction of residential accommodation on or near the city&#039;s edges is resisted. The long-term solution (which is what one should be looking to implement with £1billion) would be to deal with this future rather than the present.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409#comment-126&quot;&gt;Jacky Sutton-Adam&lt;/a&gt;.

I haven&#039;t said anything about the nature of the stations (well, I did in my ITV interview, but they showed a grand total of 5 seconds of that). My reason for using green spaces in the city centre is so that a sub-surface station can be built underneath some of the green space with minimal disruption. The only change on the surface would be some steps leading down into the station.

Even if you wanted surface-level station buildings for some reason, there&#039;s no reason the building would need to be on a different scale to the public toilets already in our green spaces (e.g. Midsummer Common, Parker&#039;s Piece, Christ&#039;s Pieces). I haven&#039;t heard complaints about those.

Elsewhere, where there are buildings that could do with replacing, station buildings could be erected. That weird road island thing that the Chesterton Staples is on has always struck me as something far better suited to having a station.

While I&#039;m on the subject of green space, I think a lot of the green space in Cambridge is used poorly. Much is college-owned or compact, while the largest expanses (the commons) are effectively fields with little in the way of maintenance, facilities or notability. Other cities do far better in this area, and it&#039;s not as if Cambridge has a lack of resources.]]></description>
