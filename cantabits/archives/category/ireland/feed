										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently came across <a href="http://www.prideinthejersey.com/">Pride In The Jersey</a>, a website about the kits of the various county-level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association">GAA</a> teams. <a href="http://www.prideinthejersey.com/jerseysindex.html">This page is particularly interesting</a> as it links to pages for each team with designs for kits dating back up to a few decades. Some of the kits have clearly gone through periods of having better and worse designs, and it&#8217;s interesting to see how long those periods have lasted!</p>
<p><span id="more-2287"></span><div id="attachment_2295" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/2287/clare-sleeve" rel="attachment wp-att-2295"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2295" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Clare-Sleeve-231x300.jpg" alt="A Clare jersey sleeve" width="231" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-2295" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Clare-Sleeve-231x300.jpg 231w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Clare-Sleeve-768x998.jpg 768w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Clare-Sleeve-788x1024.jpg 788w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2295" class="wp-caption-text">A &#8220;chevron&#8221; era Clare jersey sleeve</p></div></p>
<p>I particularly miss <a href="http://www.prideinthejersey.com/files/Clare/H2002.jpg">the &#8220;chevron&#8221; era</a> of Clare jersey designs, from 2000 to 2005. As well as having a nice design (featuring plenty of chevrons), I remember jerseys from that era (correctly) having a nice saffron colour in real life &#8211; some other Clare jerseys have been a more plain yellow or have had a subtle mix of shades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://radio.garden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Garden</a> is an interesting website I came across a while ago that allows the exploration of radio around the globe with ease. While it does have sections on History, Jingles and Stories, the most interesting feature is the ability to browse radio stations geographically and listen to them live. The website seems very well put together, working smoothly across a range of devices, making it useful for general purpose browsing and playing if your favourite stations are geographically spread.</p>
<p><span id="more-2213"></span>While the range of radio stations is surprisingly good, it is still limited and can be misleading. For example, a lot of regional radio stations in Ireland are missing: just some of the stations missing from near Limerick include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_FM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clare FM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Kerry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Kerry</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipp_FM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tipp FM</a>. Curiously, the <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/2149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently mentioned</a> Huntingdon Community Radio has only been available on some of my visits to the website.</p>

There is a nice summary of events taking place, for example, <a href="http://www.tipperary.com/uploads/docs/Brian_Boru_2014_Programme.pdf">here</a>. It&#8217;s amazing that a man from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomond">Thomond</a> made such a mark on history that he inspires such events a millennium later.</p>

<p>I think Brian Boru&#8217;s story and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_mythology">Irish mythology</a> in general (for some details of Brian&#8217;s life, such as how he died, have descended into legend) is ripe for dramatisation, like recent films and television series such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(film)">Thor</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_(2006_TV_series)">Robin Hood</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(TV_series)">Merlin</a>.</p>

The website also places a heavy emphasis on case studies, allowing visitors to get a better understanding of the reasons behind the emigration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The website of the month for June 2012 is <a href="http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/">thou shalt not commit logical fallacies</a> &#8211; a handy and good-looking website and creative commons licensed poster with quick explanations of a range of logical fallacies. Apologies for the slight lateness of this post &#8211; this month has been and will continue to be unusually busy for me. However, I have built up a larger than usual range of links to share and have enough time to do them all reasonable justice. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://deaddrops.com/">Dead Drops</a> is an interesting anonymous, offline, peer to peer file-sharing network consisting of USB flash drives are embedded into walls, buildings and curbs accessible to anybody in public space. The size of the network seems to be increasing at a good pace too, so keep an eye on it if there are none near you currently!</p>
<p>You may have missed a few less-obvious bits of mobile news lately amongst the various announcements from Apple, HTC, Samsung, Sony and others. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/4/2998403/apple-samsung-99-percent-profit-asymco">Here are some fascinating illustrations</a> of which smartphone designers/manufacturers are making money today and how this has been changing over the last 5 or so years. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/11/3013664/lg-ls970-eclipse-4g-lte-quad-core-snapdragon-s4-rumor">This is an interesting insight</a> into what those companies are cooking up for late 2012 and some of 2013. Hopefully we&#8217;ll see more software able to put the increasingly excessive power and speed to good use.</p>
<p>Google recently produced <a href="http://www.google.com/green/storyofsend/">a friendly animation explaining the process of sending an email via Gmail</a> &#8211; potentially insightful if you don&#8217;t know how a lot of the magic of the Internet happens. It features landline broadband with a Wi-Fi router on one end and a cellular (mobile) network on the other end, which leads me to a piece of information the companies above should find interesting: the HTC HD2 is one of the most popular Android phones <a href="http://opensignalmaps.com/reports/fragmentation.php">according to one study</a> (34th, if I&#8217;ve counted correctly), despite being shipped with a completely different operating system. Also, speaking of Android, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/18/3028202/mk802-android-usb-hdmi-stick">you can now get USB sticks that run Android increasingly cheaply</a>.</p>
<p>I have a few links on broader research this month too: researchers at the MIT Media Lab <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/13/3018142/zeron-mit-media-lab-levitation">have been up to some pretty cool stuff with magnets</a>, Monmouth (in Wales) <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/17/3026058/monmouth-monmouthpedia-wikipedia-town">has become the world&#8217;s first Wikipedia town</a>, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/17/3026074/starlite-maurice-ward-plastic-fireproof">Starlite is a miracle material that could be lost forever</a>, <a href="http://www.mappinglife.org/">the Map of Life</a> brings together in an easily-usable way all types of information about species distribution to support the understanding and protection of the world&#8217;s biodiversity.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Home/Cambridge-University-Press-to-hand-over-printing-work-to-another-firm-06062012.htm">Cambridge University Press, the world’s oldest printing and publishing company</a>, is handing its printing business &#8211; it does make sense to print books closer to where they are needed, though there are many other other arguments for and against what is truly the end of an era. It was also nice to see <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18328382">the Olympic torch in Ireland</a>, you can view an informative and historically accurate recreation of the great pyramids from your browser <a href="http://giza3d.3ds.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.halproject.com/">this website</a> and the screensavers it hosts are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwBmPiOmEGQ">good</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I leave you with two nice tracks from the recently released Madagascar 3 soundtrack and news that I hope to do one or two further posts this week, but will then be too busy to post for a few weeks again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The website of the month for March 2012 is <a href="http://socketcoder.com/">SocketCoder.com</a> which hosts, amongst other things, a few sample applications (and source code) that are both useful to use and useful as example code for interfacing with various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">APIs</a>. Personally, I&#8217;ve found <a href="http://socketcoder.com/ArticleFile.aspx?index=2&#038;ArticleID=44">this P2P video and voice chat system</a> to be a quick and useful solution to having a video chat with someone on the same network such that the Internet is avoided.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17034637">here is an interesting article</a> about a monument created in Ireland at an impressive speed by a local developer and others in protest against the Irish government. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16672239">This article examines the growing economic gaps between cities in the UK</a>, choosing Cambridge as its example of a city doing well. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>It also looks like I may have finally <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/90">found my HD3</a> &#8211; the HTC One X. One of the main reasons I prefer the One X to the One S (<a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/181">previously known as the HTC Ville</a>) is that, like the HD2, it doesn&#8217;t have much of a bezel around the screen. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=079x6ZYcM-o#t=2m55s">The finishes used on the One S</a> sound amazing though both devices are slightly worryingly large. It has been a long while since HTC has gone all-out like this, though I do find the non-replaceable battery and fixed amount of memory a little annoying &#8211; as nice as the free included 25GB of Dropbox storage sounds, typical data allowances (in the British Isles, at least) are only a fraction of this, rendering it unusable when Wi-Fi is unavailable. Some of the other phones announced at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_World_Congress">Mobile World Congress</a> such as the LG Optimus 4X HD and Huawei Ascend D Quad are also tempting, but I suspect that the One X will prove to be a more complete package in full reviews (I hope to revert to doing little fiddling my main personal phone, keeping my HD2 as my development device and perhaps updating it separately someday). Anyway, below is a video of the One X &#8211; the first truly exciting and reasonably-priced phone for a long while.<br />
<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tFdInvU1w4Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, below are two videos worth watching &#8211; the first a cool time-lapse starscape called &#8220;Temporal Distortion&#8221; (similar to the last video in <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/259">my previous post</a>, if you liked that), and the second a nice short animation called &#8220;No Robots&#8221;.</p>

I like the style of the apple/pear and the new &#8216;A&#8217; in the Magners logo but find the text around the edge of the label more difficult to read and the &#8216;Magners&#8217; that&#8217;s part of the bottle&#8217;s glass looks a bit messy. However, I did recently purchase a <a href="http://wearehimandher.posterous.com/magners-specials-launched">Magners Specials</a> gift pack which had labels in the same style &#8211; they had nice embossing and generally seemed higher quality and better attached to their bottles than the old Magners labels. I think the new look is growing on me. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While remarking upon this now is a bit late, I do believe it is still worth doing so. Both <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13447236">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13496918">President Barack Obama</a> visited Ireland earlier this year, and both made the effort to speak Irish. Admittedly they only spoke small amounts, but it is the gesture that counts. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
