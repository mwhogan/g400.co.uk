										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I encountered a strange issue on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pixel 2 XL</a> and thought it was worth sharing the problem, investigation and solution in case anyone experiences a similar issue.</p>
<p><span id="more-2452"></span><strong>The problem</strong><br />
One day I noticed that the videos I was recording on my Pixel 2 XL seemed silent. When playing back some videos, if I turned up the volume to it&#8217;s maximum I could just about hear loud events in the videos and a bit of hiss/static. This seemed odd as I hadn&#8217;t noticed volume problems during other regular activities that require the microphone (e.g. phone calls). As I have <a href="https://g400.co.uk/cam/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous in-depth experience with audio on Android</a> and try to minimise phone upgrades for cost and environmental reasons, I decided to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>The investigation</strong><br />
The investigation went through a number of stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I visually inspected the parts of the phone concealing microphones in case any dirt was preventing the sound from reaching the microphone. Everything seemed relatively clean.</li>
<li>Next, I tried recording video using both the front and rear cameras, as I recalled reading that camera application sometimes uses different microphones depending on which camera is used. Unfortunately the result was the same with both cameras.</li>
<li>As I hadn&#8217;t noticed the problem when using the microphones for other purposes, I tried using a couple of audio recording apps. Both were able to record good quality audio with no problems.</li>
<li>To be sure it wasn&#8217;t a problem with the camera application I cleared its storage and cache, uninstalled updates, and ran the phone in safe mode and tried an alternative camera application. Still, the problem remained.
<li>Thus far, evidence was pointing towards problems only occurring when recording video. I was aware that Android allows developers to specify different audio sources when recording and decided to remind myself of what those different audio sources were. Lo and behold, <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder.AudioSource#CAMCORDER" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android has a dedicated &#8220;camcorder&#8221; audio source</a>. I went back to the alternative camera application (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/code/ci/master/tree/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open Camera</a>) and was pleased to see that, although &#8220;camcorder&#8221; was the default audio source, I could select a different audio source. I selected the &#8220;default&#8221; source, recorded a video and played the video back: it sounded fine!</li>
<li>Although I was happy to keep using Open Camera as a workaround, I still wanted to get to the bottom of the issue. Tracing the audio source selection down through the Android source code, it looked like the selection of actual microphones was handled in <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/architecture" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">device-specific code</a>. This seemed reasonable, as details of which microphone to use for what purpose is device-specific. It also meant that if the issue was a software issue it was likely to be affecting many others with a Pixel 2 XL, but a quick search suggested that the issue was not particularly common.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The solution</strong><br />
I paused and considered what I knew:</p>
<ol>
<li>At least one audio source was broken and at least one worked.</li>
<li>Despite claiming that the &#8220;camcorder&#8221; audio source uses a microphone with the &#8220;same orientation as the camera if available&#8221;, the camera orientation wasn&#8217;t affecting the brokenness of the &#8220;camcorder&#8221; audio source.</li>
<li>The issue was quite unlikely to be a software problem.</li>
<li>Affected videos sometimes had no audio and sometimes had very, very quiet audio.</li>
</ol>
<p>This suggested that one or more of the microphones was either defective or blocked. Of the three microphones on the Pixel 2 XL, <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7157629?hl=en-GB#2017" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two are front-facing and one is on the top of the phone</a>. If the problem was with a single microphone used for any camera orientation, the microphone on top of the phone was the most plausible candidate.</p>
<p>As damaging an already defective microphone didn&#8217;t matter, I used a paperclip to carefully remove hidden dirt from deep inside the hole for the microphone on top of the phone. This solved the problem and I was able to revert to using the &#8220;camcorder&#8221; audio source.</p>
<p><strong>Further thoughts</strong><br />
I wonder why the Pixel 2 XL doesn&#8217;t use the front-facing microphones when using the front-facing camera. Perhaps the one on top is optimised for picking up ambient noise? All very interesting. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

You can drill down into sub-genres and artists &#8211; for example, <a href="http://research.google.com/bigpicture/music/#SOUNDTRACKS_CAST_ALBUMS%2CFILM_SCORES">here you can see the popularity of various film scorers</a>. Classical music is notably excluded, as the date normally associated with it is the date of its composition, not its recording.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also like to highlight <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/">The Centre for Computing History</a>, which has been <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/622">previously mentioned on this blog</a>. Apparently the necessary funding for a move to Cambridge was acquired and it opened <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/pages/28568/Visiting/">near Cambridge Retail Park and The Beehive Centre</a> on Saturday (the 27th of July).<br />
<div id="attachment_1802" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1667/the-centre-for-computing-history" rel="attachment wp-att-1802"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1802" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Centre-for-Computing-History-300x132.jpg" alt="The Centre for Computing History" width="300" height="132" class="size-medium wp-image-1802" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Centre-for-Computing-History-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Centre-for-Computing-History-500x220.jpg 500w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Centre-for-Computing-History.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1802" class="wp-caption-text">The Centre for Computing History</p></div><br />
The centre contains an interesting range of computers, some of which you will not have seen for many years and others you may not have seen in person at all! There are also many games consoles and most of the machines seem to be in good working order and powered on for you to have fun with or re-acquaint yourself with. A number of displays give plenty of information, from a brief history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers">Acorn</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad">Amstrad</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Research">Sinclair</a> to amusing famous quotes about computers from their early days. Tickets are half price until later in the year while they get all of the displays fully up and running, but there was already plenty there to do on Saturday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t often post much directly about computer science for a number of reasons &#8211; such posts tend to be particularly involved and are scientific in nature. It&#8217;s also good practice to avoid anything related to confidential knowledge I possess. I have repeatedly attempted to write a post about <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cam/">LocaMsg</a> (and, indeed, related subsequent projects such as <a href="http://chirp.io/">Chirp</a>) but such posts seem endless with my considerable knowledge of the area, and I suspend work on them.</p>
<p>Finally I have something to share of interest to people who write software or work with those who do. <a href="http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/">Programmer Interrupted</a> is a brief and academic meta Computer Science blog post about how programmers work, how they anticipate and recover from interruptions and types of memory that become heavily burdened during programming (as well as aids for memory recovery after an interruption). I find the post particularly interesting though, as implied by the &#8220;Future&#8221; section, there&#8217;s a good deal more research that should be done in the area. I was amused to find that I&#8217;ve developed (or, more likely, inadvertently picked up) the memory-aid techniques detailed. I can&#8217;t help but wonder if it makes economic sense for the larger programmer-heavy organisations to invest in their own private research to increase the productivity of their staff.</p>

If you were to visit <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/library/">the University of Cambridge Computer Lab&#8217;s library</a> and read my dissertation, you might notice that I had anticipated significant improvements to the audio hardware of phones:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mobile audio hardware may yet see a general improvement as voice communication capabilities become decreasingly important.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, that is relative to other potential functions of audio hardware &#8211; unfortunately the word limit prevented me from being more explanatory.</p>
<p>The preceding sentences in my dissertation detail the limitations I encountered:</p>
<blockquote><p>The main limitation is the quality, maximum amplitude and capabilities of the audio hardware of mobile devices, which still only perform satisfactorily at phone calls. When problems such as high THD are combined with limited amplitude and/or echoes, signal detection becomes very difficult. The limited spectrum over which the hardware performs well also prevents exploitation of more bandwidth, and ultrasonic communication.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the presumably improved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fidelity">fidelity</a> and reduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion">total harmonic distortion</a> of the HTC One&#8217;s speakers as well as increased acoustic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(telecommunications)">transmission</a> range and reduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microphone&#038;oldid=539162939#Measurements_and_specifications">microphone clipping</a> (enabling more successful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_cancellation">acoustic echo cancellation</a>) are welcome changes, the mixing of the data from the <a href="http://connect.dpreview.com/post/6522717512/htc-one-is-it-the-ultimate-camera-phone">dual membranes</a> of the microphones and SenseVoice&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response">frequency response</a> adjustment might have a more fun impact on the signal that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> framework would ultimately supply LocaMsg with.</p>
<p>I miss working in this area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Know the music you like too well? Able to anticipate its every twist and turn? <a href="http://labs.echonest.com/Uploader/index.html">The Infinite Jukebox</a> can help you &#8211; it lets you upload your own music before analysing it, looking for similar points in the music. When you get it to play, your music will seamlessly switch between those points, extending the music you uploaded into a fresh and infinitely long piece of music. Also provided by the clever and free service is a handy visualisation of the music and points between which The Infinite Jukebox thinks it can switch. I&#8217;ve found that while the switches are not completely seamless with some types of music, it works quite well &#8211; <a href="http://labs.echonest.com/Uploader/index.html?trid=TRLGGBR13AFA85A7D2">check</a> <a href="http://labs.echonest.com/Uploader/index.html?trid=TRTXWCG13845478B86">it</a> <a href="http://labs.echonest.com/Uploader/index.html?trid=TRKGOCF13B3316251C">out</a>!</p>
