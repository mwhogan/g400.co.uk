										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The population of Cambridgeshire is growing and there&#8217;s plenty of demand for further growth, but developing new places for people to live, work and play in Cambridgeshire is tricky. Cambridge itself is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Green_Belt">surrounded by green belt</a> that few seem willing to sacrifice, despite much of it being described as dull and featureless.&nbsp;There&#8217;s lots of development around Peterborough, but it cannot be expected to handle all of the population growth. A few new towns are being developed (Cambourne and Northstowe), but these are not well suited to grow beyond a certain size.</p>
<p>Notably, Cambridgeshire is curious in that it has two small-ish cities but does not yet have any large towns like Wellingborough, Corby and Kettering in neighbouring Northamptonshire. Many of the bigger towns to the east of the county (March, Wisbech and the city of Ely) are surrounded by flat, low-lying land that&#8217;s at risk of flooding by both river and, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming">in the longer term</a>, sea. On this basis, I would suggest that these towns should not be top of the list for future growth. However, the bigger towns in the west of Cambridgeshire are better suited to handling significant growth and providing Cambridgeshire with some large towns: Huntingdon and St Neots.</p>
<p><span id="more-2305"></span>There are some good reasons to be pro-development, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most certain ways to ensure the maintenance and perhaps even growth existing facilities if by growing the population they serve. For example, the argument for keeping the current range of services at Hinchingbrooke Hospital would be increasingly difficult if the Huntingdon area did not soak up much of Cambridgeshire&#8217;s population growth. A growing population <a href="https://www.nwangliaft.nhs.uk/about-us/trust-news/department-of-health-funding-approval-for-hinchingbrooke-hospital/">is already acknowledged as a factor</a> in future investment decisions.</li>
<li>By allowing large scale development, such as Alconbury Weald, you generally end up with a well-thought-out development with appropriate new facilities, green space, utilities improvements, etc. Conversely, by resisting large scale development you end up with somewhere like Cambridge or London where the quality of homes is decreasing, the price of homes is ridiculous and there are few improvements to facilities, green space, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously there&#8217;s far more discussion and debate to be had in this area, but the point of this post is not to fully examine Cambridgeshire&#8217;s growth and development opportunities or the nationwide need for growth and development. Instead, like <a href="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409">Cambridge Automated Metro</a>, I&#8217;d like to present a &#8220;What If&#8221; scenario.</p>
<p><strong>What if we strategically grew Huntingdon and St Neots towards the size of Wellingborough, Corby and Kettering?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll focus on Huntingdon in this post for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s well placed to be a focal point for Cambridgeshire other than Cambridge and Peterborough: as well as geographically, various county-wide services are headquartered there, Cambridgeshire County Council will soon be moving its headquarters to the area and it&#8217;s where a number of major transport routes (significant well beyond Cambridgeshire) meet.</li>
<li>There are some significant settlements (e.g. Godmanchester and Brampton) that have functionally been suburbs of Huntingdon for a long time.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s plenty of housebuilding occurring locally including, most notably, Alconbury Weald.</li>
<li>The local road network is about to change significantly: the ongoing A14 upgrade will see significant sections of dual carriageway in the area (Cambridge Services to Huntingdon town centre, Alconbury to Hinchingbrooke, Stukeley Meadows to Brampton Hut) become significantly underloaded, and the Alconbury Weald development is nearing the point of having its own road connection to Huntingdon.</li>
<li>Cambourne and Northstowe, like Alconbury Weald, have been built to be dependent on a larger nearby settlement for a larger range of facilities (e.g. retail, leisure, hospitals, work). The intention was probably for these to depend on Cambridge, but they also have good access to Huntingdon.</li>
<li>There are likely to be significant changes to the south of St Neots, with the Oxford to Cambridge expressway and railway due to run in that corridor, but these are still in early planning stages (e.g. the precise routes each project will take have not yet been decided).</li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting question, relevant to the section below, is the relationship between St Ives and Huntingdon. As both grow, are they close enough and related enough to be considered parts of a single greater area? The distance between them is an argument against, but it&#8217;s notable that much of the gap between them is also populated (via the villages of Houghton and Wyton) and in a number of ways St Ives and Huntingdon are treated as one. For example, there&#8217;s no overlap in terms of major supermarkets: Huntingdon has Tesco, Sainsbury&#8217;s, M&#038;S, Lidl and Aldi whereas St Ives has Wairtose, Morrisons and a Co-Op.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of creating a &#8220;Greater Huntingdon&#8221;, incorporating nearby settlements and development, could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A larger budget for events in the area and for marketing of the area for retail and tourism.</li>
<li>The significant population of the area being more easily recognisable to those looking to visit or invest in the area.</li>
<li>Better strategic planning for the area, hopefully resulting in long-term improvements to roads, public transport, amenities, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Greater Huntingdon Map</strong><br />
The main point of this post, like Cambridge Automated Metro, is to exhibit a &#8220;What If&#8221; map. Putting everything above together, along with a variety of developments, improvements, etc. that have been proposed or are under construction, produces an idea of what Huntingdon and the surrounding area could look like. Please note that my research has not been overly thorough, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to find some significant or insurmountable obstacles (e.g. wind turbines, historic landfill sites) to some more speculative features on the map. However, I have done my best to take account of many non-obvious restrictions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest">SSSIs</a> and other important green space, A14(M) and A1(M) borrow pits, and land prone to flooding. The research process has certainly been interesting and I&#8217;ve learned a lot about the history of the area. I am also bound to keep tinkering with the map and quietly updating this post: every time I look at it I see at least one thing that&#8217;s not quite right.</p>
<p>I present to you how Greater Huntingdon could look in a few decades, with a population of approximately 100,000:<br />

<li>Light blue (and very fuzzy): potential areas for further development</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes on map features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The level of detail on the map is fairly arbitrary: clearly I&#8217;ve taken more interest in some areas than others. For example, the whole of Huntingdon town centre is marked as retail (despite the substantial number of homes, Huntingdonshire District Council HQ, etc.) whereas the new Cambridgeshire County Council HQ gets its own purple blob. It would be extremely time consuming to add a great amount of detail across the map, such as an appropriately coloured blob for every shop and green space.
<li>I&#8217;ve given names to some future developments to help make the map more intelligible. For clarity, I&#8217;ve generally reused existing placenames and augmented them. For example, as well as Stukeley Meadows, we now have Stukeley Hillside. They&#8217;re very much just placeholders though and many could be improved.</li>
<li>This map deliberately doesn&#8217;t make it clear what is within Greater Huntingdon and what&#8217;s just near it. Exactly where the line could and should be drawn is up for debate. As discussed above, Godmanchester, Brampton and Alconbury Weald are very strong candidates. Given Alconbury Weald, the Stukeleys and the Alconburys are not unreasonable candidates too. St Ives is more debatable, though it will soon be connected to Huntingdon and Godmanchester by a dual carriageway virtually dedicated to the three towns and, as discussed above, Huntingdon and St Ives are already treated as one on some levels. If St Ives is included, it makes sense to include everything between Huntingdon and St Ives. The population figure includes all of these as well as Fenstanton, the Offords and Buckden, as these would be close satellite villages.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve included a third river crossing as it has been in the news again recently. From what I can remember, any time there has been talk of a third river crossing, it has been from Godmanchester to Hartford. I&#8217;ve included that on the map as a dotted line, along with two alternative options, from Godmanchester to Hinchingbrooke and Godmanchester to Brampton. There are a couple of reasons for this: Brampton Road and its junctions (specifically Hinchingbrooke Park Road and the train station junction) are well known for being overwhelmed for a number of hours every day (this seems likely to get worse with the A14 upgrade) and both options would also provide a fourth vehicular route for crossing the East Coast Main Line. As usual, there has been thinking about some detail (e.g. notice how the Godmanchester-Brampton link follows some of the path of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettering,_Thrapston_and_Huntingdon_Railway">the old Huntingdon-Kettering railway</a>), but there&#8217;s plenty more that I&#8217;d need to investigate before considering the proposal serious. The Godmanchester to Hartford crossing is still a useful and valid option for allowing A1307 and A1198 traffic to reach the A141 without going through Huntingdon.</li>
<li>An improved A141 (partially on a new alignment), which has been a distant plan for some time, is included. I&#8217;ve suggested dualling this to Wyton airfield as it&#8217;s already quite busy at peak times and will be made yet busier by the new developments. It would be nice for some of junctions it has to be <a href="https://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Grade_Separated_Junction">grade-separated</a>, but that would require a more significant upgrade proposal (it would have to have far fewer junctions spend much of its length running significantly below or above the natural ground level).</li>
<li>Given the third river crossing and improved A141, I&#8217;ve included the development of Wyton airfield (a little different from the proposed masterplan: much more green space), which would become much more accessible.</li>
<li>After researching and drawing the map, potential future areas for development (beyond specific current proposals) became clearer, and I&#8217;ve marked these as very fuzzy light-blue blobs. Topography and major roads make much development to the west difficult. There is much more potential around the southern edge of Godmanchester and to the north and north-east of Huntingdon though.</li>
<li>There are various other minor interesting things on the map, such as an extension of Huntingdon Retail Park to the north of the A141 and something interesting on Views Common (to make the most of the good access) but, as with Cambridge Automated Metro, I&#8217;ll leave such details for others to find and think about for themselves.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been a long time since <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/831" target="_blank">I originally posted about Geoff Zanelli</a>. In that time he has worked on a number of films, taking on an increasingly prominent role. When I heard that he was taking over as lead composer for the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film (Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar&#8217;s Revenge), <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/2194" target="_blank">I was excited to listen to the result</a>. Just over a month ago I was lucky enough to see the film and I was not disappointed.</p>

<p><span id="more-2227"></span><strong>Originality versus continuity</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like a slightly nuanced point: I think that <em>both</em> originality and continuity are important in soundtracks. With more and more film scores failing to stray too far from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temp_track" target="_blank">temp tracks</a>, originality perhaps adds more value than ever. However, one of my biggest gripes lately is sequels with soundtracks that are barely related to the preceding film(s) (I&#8217;m looking at you Marvel). Yes, a change in tone, new themes, etc. are normally required, but that doesn&#8217;t mean everything needs to be thrown out of the window! Themes can be re-arranged and motifs can be reused where they could enhance the sense that we are seeing the same characters or places in new situations.</p>
<p>A good example of this problem is the Thor series. I like both Patrick Doyle&#8217;s score for the original film and Brian Tyler&#8217;s Score for Thor: The Dark World. While the scores are not worlds apart, I feel the series is really let down by the sudden and complete change in themes from one film to the next. The soundtrack is very much part of the identity of a film, so having so little continuity contributes to it being <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/12/12889722/marvel-music-weak-blockbusters" target="_blank">relatively forgettable in the scheme of things</a>.</p>
<p>Many other soundtracks &#8211; even the Harry Potter film series, the first few of which were scored by the great John Williams &#8211; do better but leave room for improvement, in my opinion. Admittedly, soundtracks for film series where the journey and ending are known, such as The Lord of the Rings, are easier to score in many ways. However, in the Harry Potter case, the original themes weren&#8217;t brilliantly targeted: Hedwig was unlikely to benefit from a dedicated theme.</p>
<p>I suspect that, where there is a change in composer between films, licensing issues play some part in the poor reuse of themes. This is a shame as subjecting the same music to different creative minds can produce interesting results. The &#8220;Heroes&#8221; track from Avengers: Age of Ultron is a good example of the opportunities that were available in Marvel&#8217;s films.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates of the Caribbean 5</strong></p>
<p>Back to Geoff&#8217;s score for Pirates 5: thankfully Geoff does make plenty of use of the rich library of themes inherited from previous Pirates of the Caribbean movies, to which he contributed significantly. Even where they do crop up, they are rarely played in exactly the same way, helping to keep them fresh. One of the most fun examples of this is &#8220;The Dying Gull&#8221;, which mostly consists of a rendition of &#8220;Hoist The Colours&#8221;:<br />
<iframe loading="lazy" width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c6QCPthBgWs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>We do see plenty of new themes too, both borrowing from, and pushing the boundaries of, the sounds of the previous Pirates of the Caribbean films. In a franchise so rich with bad guys, each supposedly worse than the preceding one, it can&#8217;t be easy to come up with themes for them. One of the most interesting tracks in this respect is &#8220;El Matador Del Mar&#8221;, which showcases both Salazar&#8217;s theme and fresh arrangements of numerous old themes as Jack becomes Captain Jack Sparrow:<br />
<iframe loading="lazy" width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZkYTB3xYVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Carina also has a great theme that is used to push the &#8220;Pirates&#8221; sound into new territory. The following example, &#8220;The Brightest Star in the North&#8221;, is the best example of this and features a brief similarity to my own arrangement of &#8220;Drunken Sailor&#8221; at 3:35:<br />
<iframe loading="lazy" width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02eSX7gOvXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Even with these new themes, Geoff never strays too far from the existing &#8220;Pirates&#8221; sound to join everything together. In the soundtrack&#8217;s final track, &#8220;Beyond My Beloved Horizon&#8221;, Carina&#8217;s theme sounds like it could always have been the &#8220;B&#8221; section of &#8220;He&#8217;s A Pirate&#8221;:<br />
<iframe loading="lazy" width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DebUsNalptU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>It&#8217;s tempting to put feature many more tracks here, but I&#8217;ll resist the temptation. Instead, you can check them out for yourself. Interestingly and usefully, Disney has made the entire soundtrack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneyMusicVEVO/videos" target="_blank">available on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of the soundtrack as a whole is the generous quantity of music. Previous Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack albums have been relatively short or padded out with remixes, often missing some of the most beautiful music from the films. This is not the case with Pirates 5: well over an hour of original music is included on the CD and the single remix associated with it is banished to the downloadable album.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>Overall, I really do like Geoff&#8217;s new soundtrack: it has a great balance of freshened up versions of what we know and love along with great new content that feels at home in the &#8220;Pirates&#8221; universe. I am a great fan of Hans, but giving Geoff the opportunity to take centre stage this time has allowed the soundtrack to move forward in exciting ways and has been a welcome breath of fresh air. Hopefully this will lead to further great opportunities for Geoff.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as he contributed significantly to the previous four Pirates of the Caribbean soundtracks before taking the wheel for the latest installment, Geoff seems to have been given a lot of opportunity to <a href="http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=17548" target="_blank">talk to the press about Pirates 5</a>. The view into his world is fascinating. Below is a brief &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; video of a Pirates 5 recording session:<br />
<iframe loading="lazy" width="584" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PGMB_lYw9I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re still reading, here&#8217;s a lengthy but very interesting interview with Geoff himself, covering mostly his history in the industry and the latest Pirates soundtrack:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have noticed over the last few years, since becoming Cantabits the image at the top of this blog rapidly evolved into a monthly image of a particular tree near Cambridge. As the seasons changed, so did the image. Recently, I decided that it was time for a change &#8211; since December 2013 I&#8217;ve been uploading different images. Already, with photos of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire_Guided_Busway">the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_Main_Line">the East Coast Main Line</a> and a road leading into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetford_Forest">Thetford Forest</a>, a transport theme seems to have emerged. However, I expect this to evolve further over time and there&#8217;s no longer a need to keep updating the image regularly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I have been busy doing recently was <a href="http://www.student-parliaments.eu/local-parliaments-2013-14/local-student-parliaments/cambridge.html">a talk for the University of Cambridge about &#8216;Future Mobility&#8217;</a> at <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/public-engagement/news/debate-science-european-student-parliament">the European Student Science Parliament held there</a>. Specifically, I was talking as an expert (due to my work building up to and resulting in <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409">Cambridge Automated Metro</a>) about the future of sustainable transport options in cities with historic cores, like Cambridge. This was my third time giving a talk like this, and I quite enjoyed it. Like <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1081">the blog post that preceded Cambridge Automated Metro</a>, it&#8217;s fun to have an excuse to research one&#8217;s ideas further and wrap up the results into a good summary. A talk is a particularly good format to convey this summary in, as it can be adjusted to suit the audience and feedback from the audience is normally genuine and useful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following on from <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1081">a post back in February</a>, I had a brief go at imagining what an underground light rail system for Cambridge would look like (after all, <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Cambridge-politicians-are-failing-city-business-20130326122218.htm">Cambridge needs a bit more political ambition and vision</a>). Maybe, with <a href="http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/CMSWebsite/Apps/News/Details.aspx?ref=1016">at least £1billion potentially being unlocked soon for transport in the Greater Cambridge area</a>, something like this could be implemented &#8211; I certainly hope that it at least generates debate about the sorely needed transport investment in and around the city. While I haven&#8217;t done all of the analyses that I&#8217;d like (I&#8217;m not getting paid for this, unsurprisingly), I have tried to connect up a number of the hotspots highlighted on the map <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Tunnel-vision-to-keep-city-on-the-move-31012013.htm">here</a> with key transport links, attempted to avoid historic buildings (points at which the Cam can be crossed are somewhat limited by this) and given some thought to splitting the project into lines which also represent key stages. As noted on the proposal summary below, I have assumed a deep-level system &#8211; a cut-and-cover system would add the additional constraint of generally following roads.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1647" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/1409/cambridge-automated-metro" rel="attachment wp-att-1647"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1647" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cambridge-Automated-Metro-1024x576.png" alt="Cambridge Automated Metro Proposal" width="584" height="328" class="size-large wp-image-1647" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cambridge-Automated-Metro-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cambridge-Automated-Metro-300x168.png 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cambridge-Automated-Metro-500x281.png 500w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cambridge-Automated-Metro.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1647" class="wp-caption-text">What an underground <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docklands_Light_Railway">DLR</a>-style railway for Cambridge might look like.</p></div><span id="more-1409"></span>One small annoyance I have with the proposal above was the inability to serve Cambridge Retail Park and the Beehive Centre while also serving central Cambridge (Petersfield, Kite and Midsummer Common &#8211; sites, you&#8217;ll notice, where there is considerable green space and/or buildings that won&#8217;t be missed, so stations can be built) without doing a couple of sharp turns. I think there is less of an economic or mid-term case for a east-west line through the city centre (I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much development planned on this axis), but there are still a few plausible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-route the &#8216;Central&#8217; and &#8216;South&#8217; lines so that the &#8216;Central&#8217; line serves (after Chesterton) Cambridge Retail Park and the Beehive Centre before proceeding to Cambridge Station, Addenbrooke&#8217;s and Trumpington while the &#8216;South&#8217; line serves (after Cherry Hinton) Cambridge Station and Petersfield before terminating at Kite.</li>
<li>Following on from the previous option, there would also be potential to have the &#8216;South&#8217; line terminus further west near or in Lion Yard, the Grand Arcade or Cambridge University&#8217;s New Museums Site (which will <a href="http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/Development-plans-for-central-Cambridge-University-sites-20130402060000.htm">soon be undergoing redevelopment</a>).</li>
<li>The modified &#8216;South&#8217; line could go further west still before terminating, with the line crossing the Cam not far from The Fen Causeway (avoiding the colleges to the North of this) so that it can serve the Newtown, Mill Pond and/or Newnham areas and/or Cambridge University&#8217;s Sidgwick Site, before possibly meeting the North Line at West Cambridge.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposal detailed in the map would be structurally closest to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rapid_transit&#038;oldid=550074383#Network_types">X-system</a> whereas the alternative detailed textually would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rapid_transit&#038;oldid=550074383#Network_types">Secant-system</a> &#8211; the cities in which these can be found would suggest that the former is more suitable for a city and metropolitan area of Cambridge&#8217;s size and structure.</p>
<p>Back-of-an-envelope calculations suggest that the number of stations envisaged should provide a London-like ratio of population to stations, ensuring financial viability. Obviously the city deal that Cambridge may get would significantly help with funding the constuction but there are other methods of raising money, depending on how much is needed and how aggressively adoption of the system is to be pushed. One aggressive solution for the phases depicted could involve city-wide parking restrictions that penalize overnight parking to ensure that the beneficiaries (residents of the city) are incentivised to use the system (residents who want a car for travel within Cambridge should put a garage-like facility higher up their list of priorities and those who need to travel by car outside of Cambridge could use the Park and Ride car parks for overnight parking). Further phases, to nearby towns and villages, could be funded via a city-wide congestion charge. However, if such an anti-car philosophy is being followed, it might be cheaper to simply convert most of Cambridge&#8217;s main roads into a tram-like surface-level light rail system, leaving enough roads for access (residential, commercial and emergency).</p>
<p>In the image below I&#8217;ve tried to envision what a smart card for the Cambridge Automated Metro (the equivalent of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_card">Oyster Card</a>) would look like. It uses the colours I&#8217;ve given the lines, to maintain a consistent look. It took a while to make the card not look too flag-like!</p>

I updated it from the <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cam/">LocaMsg</a> icon when I was doing early work on the Cambridge Automated Metro idea, coming up with logo symbol designs. The logos used in the images above, the favicon and a few more designs can be found in the image below.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/blog/pl/technology/htc_touch">HTC Touch</a>, the <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/blog/pl/technology/htc_touch_diamond_review">HTC Touch Diamond</a>, the <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/blog/pl/technology/htc_hd2_official_announcement">HTC HD2</a> and the <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/blog/pl/technology/htc_sensation_announcement">HTC Sensation</a> before it, the HTC One X is a generational leap beyond its predecessors.

Over the extended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter">Easter</a> weekend I put my One X through its paces, so read on to find out&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-343"></span></p>
<p><strong>Design and build quality</strong></p>
<p>Design has been one of HTC&#8217;s strengths since since <a href="http://www.oneandco.com/casestudy_01.html">working with</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/03/htc-acquires-design-firm-one-and-co/">eventually acquiring</a> One &#038; Co. It is therefore pleasing that HTC has returned to exploiting this strength after two years of phones converging on a chunky (by today&#8217;s standards), largely aluminium 4.3-inch-screened device.</p>
<div id="attachment_418" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/343/htc_one_x_body" rel="attachment wp-att-418"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-418" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_body-1024x320.jpg" alt="The HTC One X&#039;s body" title="The HTC One X&#039;s body" width="584" height="182" class="size-large wp-image-418" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_body-1024x320.jpg 1024w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_body-300x93.jpg 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_body-500x156.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-418" class="wp-caption-text">The One X is curvy and sleek</p></div>
<p>The One X looks stunning from every angle. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gorilla_Glass&#038;oldid=485604923#Gorilla_Glass_2.0">Gorilla Glass 2</a> on the front slopes near-seamlessly into the curved polycarbonate unibody &#8211; the small bump at the edge of the screen providing tactile feedback when you&#8217;ve swiped or dragged far enough. The vast majority of the space on the front of the device is taken up by the screen and yet through the wrapping around of the unibody and the curving and sloping of the screen&#8217;s edges, it certainly differentiates itself from the considerable number of large black slabs on the market.</p>
<div id="attachment_411" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/343/htc_one_x_screen" rel="attachment wp-att-411"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-411" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_Screen.jpg" alt="HTC One X Screen" title="HTC One X Screen" width="1000" height="750" class="size-full wp-image-411" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_Screen.jpg 1000w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_Screen-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_Screen-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-411" class="wp-caption-text">The screen of the HTC One X</p></div>
<p>The screen itself looks superb &#8211; pixels are virtually invisible to the naked eye, colour reproduction is as good as I&#8217;ve seen for a LCD and brightness is good too. Strangely, my One X didn&#8217;t have the automatic backlight adjustment on by default.</p>
<div id="attachment_417" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/343/htc_one_x_capacitive_buttons" rel="attachment wp-att-417"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-417" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_capacitive_buttons-1024x400.jpg" alt="The HTC One X&#039;s capacitive buttons" title="The HTC One X&#039;s capacitive buttons" width="584" height="228" class="size-large wp-image-417" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_capacitive_buttons-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_capacitive_buttons-300x117.jpg 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_capacitive_buttons-500x195.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-417" class="wp-caption-text">The HTC One X&#039;s capacitive buttons</p></div>
<p>Below the screen are three capacitive buttons with haptic feedback. The layout of the buttons is somewhat frustrating and unlike other devices of mine with a back button. Instead of placing the back button near the thumb if holding the device in your right hand, it is actually the furthest button and not easy to reach in a one-handed grip. Instead, the easiest button to press is the less  useful multitasking button. However, this is more of an issue with the direction that Android is heading in than the One X as the Samsung Galaxy Nexus has the same on-screen button layout and a similarly large screen.</p>
<p>Thus far the the earpiece and external speaker have remained dirt-free, mainly due to the fact the holes drilled through the phone&#8217;s polycarbonate shell are incredibly small. The volume when playing music seems good, though I have missed a few calls in noisy environments &#8211; perhaps an issue with volume but also perhaps due to the poorer than average vibration capabilities or just me not yet being familiar with the ringtone (I&#8217;ve got mine set to <a href="http://www.zedge.net/ringtone/1447298/">an interesting blast from the past</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the main camera is not recessed relative to the protruding metal ring around it, making it a target for scratches. Similarly, the front-facing camera is also sub-optimally designed &#8211; this time being so small and so far recessed that it&#8217;s prone to picking up dirt.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons I have the white version of the One X, and it is worth noting that it does pick up some dirt and colours from clothes. Nothing that a rub and sometimes a drop or two of water can&#8217;t handle though.</p>
<div id="attachment_414" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/343/htc_one_x_vs_htc_hd2" rel="attachment wp-att-414"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-414" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_vs_HTC_HD2.jpg" alt="The HTC One X alongside the HTC HD2" title="The HTC One X alongside the HTC HD2" width="800" height="545" class="size-full wp-image-414" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_vs_HTC_HD2.jpg 800w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_vs_HTC_HD2-300x204.jpg 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_vs_HTC_HD2-440x300.jpg 440w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-414" class="wp-caption-text">Comparison of the HTC One X and HTC HD2</p></div>
<p>Finally, and surprisingly, the device is very light &#8211; lighter than the HD2 and though it&#8217;s not as light as the Touch Diamond, it feels as light. This is likely due to the lack of metal used in the phone&#8217;s polycarbonate unibody shell as well as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_polymer_battery">lithium-ion polymer</a> battery.</p>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_399" style="width: 178px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/343/htc_one_x_screenshot" rel="attachment wp-att-399"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-399" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_screenshot-168x300.png" alt="HTC One X Screenshot" title="HTC One X Screenshot" width="168" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-399" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_screenshot-168x300.png 168w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_screenshot-576x1024.png 576w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_screenshot.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-399" class="wp-caption-text">HTC Sense 4</p></div>
<p>I am a fan of HTC Sense &#8211; while using plain Android on my HD2 I did miss a lot of the shortcuts and functionality it that Sense provided me with as well as the high quality and uniformly themed widgets. Sense 4, which can be found on the One X, cuts out many of the nice but frivolous animations. There are still a limited number of visually pleasing enhancements such as a limited third dimension to the homescreen transitions. It is disappointing to see the &#8216;pinch to switch tabs&#8217; feature no longer in the browser and <a href="http://www.htcsense.com/">HTCSense.com</a> gone for now (I hope to see something similarly useful in its place soon). I am looking forward to testing the included Movie Editor app as I record more videos.</p>
<p>One annoyance which will hopefully eventually disappear is that a lot of apps, sometimes inexplicably, cause a menu button to be displayed at the bottom of the screen. This is not much of an issue when it facilitates use of an older application but it also displays when running applications such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nvidia.demo.glowball">NVIDIA&#8217;s Glowball</a>, which appears to have no use for it. From a developer&#8217;s perspective, I suspect HTC may be checking for the presence of methods such as <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onCreateOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu)">onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu)</a> but not running them to get a return value for fear that applications could do something in reaction other than populate a menu and say whether or not it should be displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Camera and Music</strong></p>

<p>The camera software, as HTC will tell you, is fantastic. I do find it slightly misleading though that the default camera mode is called &#8216;Auto&#8217; but never invokes features from other modes. It would be handy and not infeasible for it to automatically turn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">HDR</a> on or off based on lighting conditions, turn on portrait or group portrait based on face detection, landscape and close up based on autofocus feedback and panorama based on camera motion. I did encounter one bug a number of times, though not enough to yet be sure of how to reproduce it: periodic focus hunting while recording video, as featured in the video below.</p>
<p><object width="560" height="315" ><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="movie" value="http://www.facebook.com/v/10150663172958924" /><embed src="http://www.facebook.com/v/10150663172958924" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="315"></embed></object></p>
<p>Overall the camera is not perfect and it&#8217;s still perfectly capable of taking bad photos in the right conditions, but it&#8217;s definitely a lot easier to use and takes good photos in far more conditions than any other phone camera I&#8217;ve seen. The panorama mode, for example, seems to do some matching of features in images rather than naïvely fading them into each other, but doesn&#8217;t warp the images where necessary to match both nearer and further objects. I&#8217;ve not yet been in good situations to test the single-LED flash which supposedly flashes with one of five brightness levels depending on the distance of the subject.</p>
<div id="attachment_398" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/343/htc_one_x_panoramas" rel="attachment wp-att-398"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-398" loading="lazy" src="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_panoramas-1024x463.jpg" alt="Panoramas by HTC One X" title="Panoramas by HTC One X" width="584" height="264" class="size-large wp-image-398" srcset="https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_panoramas-1024x463.jpg 1024w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_panoramas-300x135.jpg 300w, https://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HTC_One_X_panoramas-500x226.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-398" class="wp-caption-text">A demonstration of the One X&#039;s panorama capabilities</p></div>
<p>I must disagree with HTC over the quality of their music software. Not only does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Electronics">Beats Audio</a> by definition reduce the authenticity of the music (unless the response curve of the hardware through which the audio is being played is known and compensated for) but even when I turned it off I found that my musical experience with the included earphones was inferior to that of my previous HTC devices. I found the external speaker to be more satisfactory compared to my previous devices though and quite loud. I prefer Android&#8217;s default music application to the custom music application included &#8211; as well as hiding the list of files currently playing in a popover menu (and calling it a queue, with the currently playing file being referred to as &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; &#8211; something that caused me to be unable to get to the list of currently playing files for several days), the application seems to go to the &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; screen if you ever leave it and come back to the application. This is particularly annoying as I like to browse through my files, searching for the next thing I want to hear, and sometimes have to leave the application briefly. Jumping to &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; is pointless to me as the same information and controls are available on the lockscreen, as a widget and as a notification.</p>

<p>I have encountered occasional software glitches, but nothing that&#8217;s unusual these days for the first firmware version. Bugs have included the camera failing to start successfully once and the screen occasionally turning back on immediately after turning it off.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware and Gaming</strong></p>
<p>Few people typically use their phone in such a way that a quad-core 1.5GHz CPU is particularly necessary. Indeed, I am not amongst that few. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that it can&#8217;t be noticed even during the most mundane tasks. Even when running Android 2.3, which it was pretty good at, my HD2 would occasionally lag for a moment before switching <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">activities</a> and sometimes even have to catch up with a few back button presses. However, the One X flies through all screen transitions. The browser loads with ease and smoothly scrolls through pages that the HD2&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)">single-core 1GHz Scorpion CPU</a> would not enjoy loading and jerkily scroll through. The phone manages to keep this smoothness up even when it&#8217;s up to a variety of tasks at once.</p>

The right screenshot shows the train journey mentioned in the text below and many hours of little activity. For me, both days were unusually hard on the battery.</p></div>
<p>Surprisingly, this speed is achieved with impressively low power consumption. Despite the larger screen and much more powerful processor, the One X happily survived a day involving a 50-minute-long train journey spent listening to music while uploading photos and videos over a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Speed_Packet_Access">HSPA</a>-only mobile network while I also reviewed and captioned the photos and videos. Such abuse would&#8217;ve drained about half of the HD2&#8217;s battery, but only used 20-30% of the One X&#8217;s battery. Excluding the first day, as the battery takes a few charges to exhibit normal battery life, the battery has easily lasted all day for me so far despite all of the setting up, testing and real use I&#8217;ve put it through (I had a busy weekend).</p>
<p>Some features I have not yet tested include Bluetooth, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance">DLNA</a>, GPS, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Direct">Wi-Fi Direct</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication">NFC</a> &#8211; I tend not to use these features regularly, though it is nice to have them there for the occasions when they are useful.</p>
<p>Thus far I haven&#8217;t had too much opportunity to explore Tegra-specific games other than <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nvidia.demo.glowball">Glowball</a>, which looks fantastic though seems to be optimised for tablets. Non-Tegra-specific games are super-smooth but obviously have more average graphics. I was amused to see that Teeter was included and that (to the point I&#8217;ve played it to) it&#8217;s still the same as the original version on the HTC Touch Diamond.</p>

<p>Unlike most phones lately, which have been priced too highly or have struggled to stand out from the competition, I think the One X is competitively priced at just under £500 in the UK. However, if like most people you don&#8217;t purchase your phones outright and instead get them with a contract, the news is worse &#8211; most contracts in the UK at the moment that include phones are awfully priced. It&#8217;s easier to lose money relative to buying the phone outright than get it subsidised by your network. Two and a half years ago my HTC HD2, for example, was effectively £190 cheaper with a contract than it was to buy outright. This is the fault of the networks and something to be wary of in general as they clearly attempt to settle <a href="http://www.cramton.umd.edu/papers2000-2004/01nao-cramton-report-on-uk-3g-auction.pdf">their 3G spectrum auction debts</a> and save for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/oct/11/4g-spectrum-auction">the 4G spectrum auction that will hopefully happen in the next year or so</a>.</p>

<p>The HTC One X is the best phone available today. But is it the phone you&#8217;ve been waiting for? Possibly.</p>
<p>Small-handed people would struggle to use it due to its sheer size &#8211; for these people I would not recommend the One X and I would be wary of suggesting its smaller sibling S, which has a similar height though reduced width and thickness. Of HTC&#8217;s One range, probably only One V is suitable if size is your concern. The One V is also suitable for those who don&#8217;t need the latest and greatest phone &#8211; with similar specs to the HD2 and the same camera software as the One X, it is actually pretty good despite being roughly half the price of its larger siblings.</p>
<p>If you need a lot of data while on the go, the lack of microSD card slot is a problem though the 32GB of internal storage is generous. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fonleap.pocketvm">PocketVM</a> will let you store more files than you otherwise could while wirelessly letting you see them on any computer you come to. And if that&#8217;s not enough, the One X comes with 25GB of cloud storage.</p>
<p>Of considerable concern is what Apple and Samsung may release later this year. However, you know more about this than you might think &#8211; the pros and cons of the Android and iOS ecosystems are unlikely to change rapidly, Apple rarely varies a number of specs (e.g. screen size) and Samsung is highly likely to use an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED">AMOLED</a> screen.</p>
<p>I am unfortunate enough to live in a part of the world that doesn&#8217;t look likely to get any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution">LTE</a> networks at all until 2013, and probably won&#8217;t get a decent level of coverage until near the middle of this decade. However, if you would benefit from a phone with 4G capabilities then the HTC One X might not be for you. Luckily, the HTC One XL is near-identical except it&#8217;s powered by a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon, has LTE capabilities and has only 16GB of internal storage (presumably you&#8217;re supposed to store more online and take advantage of the superior mobile network speeds).</p>
<p>Personally, I would highly recommend the One X. It&#8217;s obviously not for everyone (hence the One S and One V), but it is certainly the phone that many people have been waiting for: it is, in spirit, the <a href="http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/90">HD3</a>.</p>
