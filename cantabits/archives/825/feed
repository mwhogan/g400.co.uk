I don&#039;t think it will automatically reinstall your apps - all of the apps you have ever downloaded are listed in a special place in (and are free to download from) Google Play (menu button -&gt; &quot;My Apps&quot; -&gt; &quot;All&quot;). However, when you do reinstall an app, your settings and data for that app should be restored if you have &quot;Back up my settings&quot; and &quot;Automatic restore&quot; checked in &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Personal&quot; -&gt; &quot;Backup &amp; reset&quot;. Unfortunately, as you can see from &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the developer documentation for the backup feature&lt;/a&gt;, such functionality is not compulsory and there will certainly be some apps that don&#039;t use it.

I had thought that this feature would be taken advantage of by the Messages application for backing up SMS/MMS messages, but I don&#039;t think it does as it seems to offer its own &quot;Back up/Restore SMS&quot; option in its menu.

I guess there is no single relatively simple and guaranteed way of backing up and restoring everything on Android. :(]]></description>

Well I suppose that&#039;s one way to fix the problem! I hadn&#039;t realised that they had removed the Show Me app until I read your post.

I am going to try Tasks again, now I have updated. Glad they&#039;ve fixed the date issue.

As regards backup, you say &quot;If you‚Äôve set up your phone appropriately, everything should be restored from Google&quot; does that include re-installing all the apps, Text messages etc..?]]></description>

The clock/weather problem does sound quite bad. &quot;Show Me&quot; doesn&#039;t seem to be present at all in the Android 4.1 update, which solves that problem.

The tasks thing might be fixed in the Android 4.1 update that rolled out recently - I notice that they&#039;ve changed a lot of details of how the tasks work including removing the time they&#039;re due (only the due date remains), grouping by due date in the widget, moving the ability to postpone tasks to a menu (and reducing the postpone options to 1 day and 1 week, as time is no longer relevant) and fixing the format of the due date shown in the widget (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/476#comment-96&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).

If you&#039;ve set up your phone appropriately, everything should be restored from Google (see things like the &quot;Backup &amp; reset&quot; option in the settings). I haven&#039;t used any backup methods other than this and the methods I gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.g400.co.uk/cantabits/archives/825#comment-83&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt; for a long time, and I consequently wouldn&#039;t be confident in recommending an appropriate app. The descriptions, screenshots and reviews on Google Play are normally sufficiently good quality indicators.]]></description>

The clock/weather problem, if I remember rightly (it&#039;s some time ago now) crashed everytime I tried to access Alarms - this was the one time that factory reset resolved the issue. I was amazed this phone had a bug as soon as I switched it on! But on this occasion HTC support were excellent!

I&#039;m fairly sure the data loss after the &quot;showme&quot; app problem arose from HTC technical support telling me to do a storage delete. It deleted all the data for the &quot;locations&quot; app which I did manage to download again, it also removed all the sample, pictures, music and videos.

The tasks problem arises on my phone when I put a task in the HTC tasks widget, if I have tasks set to display in the calendar it shows 2 copies of each task. HTC claim another factory reset will resolve but I haven&#039;t had time to try it. I&#039;ve got more important things to do than setup my phone again and again. However a good backup program may help me here. I would like to find one that will backup all apps, text messages and settings so I don&#039;t have to spend ages resetting the phone - can you recommend one to do this? I will take another look on Google play to see if I can find something suitable...]]></description>

I&#039;m curious - what was the clock/weather problem?

I haven&#039;t got much familiarity with Show Me, I&#039;m afraid - I&#039;ve just looked at it for the first time, and I recognise the videos from YouTube, so maybe try watching them there: http://www.youtube.com/user/HTCShowMe/videos. With all of the factory resets I&#039;ve done (I&#039;ve done all sorts of things with phones for research and work purposes), I&#039;ve never lost any data - the phone is normally capable of restoring everything on its internal memory to its original state and the rest of the storage (the 25GB internal partition on the One X, the microSD card on phones that have them) is left alone by the process, in my experience. Have you tried looking for the original data on the xda-developers forum? That normally has everything you need when things go wrong.

I haven&#039;t seen any Tasks problems personally - that&#039;s one of my favourite apps. Driver installation can be tricky, but I agree that HTC&#039;s software for non-mobile operating systems is poor. There are also thousands of apps for backing up data on Google Play, and ClockworkMod Recovery (http://forum.xda-developers.com/wiki/ClockworkMod_Recovery) provides backup and restore facilities that bypass the need for Android to be present or working at all, though I think the best method is Android&#039;s built-in backup facility (there&#039;s a vaguely approachable tool for using it here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1844032).

Indeed, it is a shame that your phone has such annoying issues. One drastic option would be to install plain Android on it (though that&#039;s not guaranteed to be any less buggy): http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1786696]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am starting to wonder about the HTC One X I have had lots of issues with it in the short time I have owned mine.

The advice I always get is to do a factory reset, out of the three problems I have reported this has only worked on one so far! But, it seems to be a standard response? It is very time consuming and shouldn&#039;t really be necessary if the phone had, had all the issues sorted before it was put on the market. The phone; an HTC One X has had 3 software related problems already, I have only had it approx 2 months!

1. Fault with clock/weather HTC app - solved satisfactorily with factory reset.

2. Fault with &quot;Show Me&quot; HTC app - This one still hasn&#039;t been explained satisfactorily, factory reset, cache clear and storage delete was the advice given to me, however didn&#039;t help one bit! A few days later the issue suddenly cured itself, but as a result of the above advice a lot of data (supplied with the phone was irrecoverably lost) and HTC were unable or unwilling to supply the missing files saying they weren&#039;t available? How do they copy this data to every new phone manufactured then?

3. Fault with &quot;Tasks&quot; HTC app duplicating entries in the calendar - still to be resolved... I haven&#039;t had time to do another Factory reset yet and I am fed up with losing all my data, apps and customisations every time! Also, I was advised to install &quot;Sync manager&quot; on my phone to backup it up - I spent a whole night trying to install it because it kept failing, refusing to find the correct drivers (bad programming I suspect) eventually I had to e-mail support again to get this solved, but it was not a neat solution having to install an earlier bit of software made by HTC and cancel the install once the drivers had loaded - why?? - This looks very unprofessional, not what I was expecting from HTC at all!

It&#039;s a real shame as the phone is great most of the time... Just getting fed up with having to re-install all my settings every time I have a software issue! Feeling like a Guinea pig for HTC right now!]]></description>
