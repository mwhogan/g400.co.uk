Thanks! Nice. :) I&#039;ll have a look at that - I&#039;m sure my girlfriend will be able to help with trying it out and generating feedback. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Mark--

I like the way you write!  I got a Google alert from one of your posts and just read that you are from Cambridge. I am sort of seeing someone from that part of the world!  Anyway, I noticed that you have a website of the month feature.  I&#039;d love to submit my site WeareverTheWeather.com for your consideration.  It&#039;s a recommendation engine for women that shows them what to wear based on the weather forecast of any location.  I invite you to try it (although you may not want to shop any of it for yourself!).  Let me know what you think.

Thanks!
Renae]]></description>

Apparently it has Gravatar support too. I didn&#039;t think much else came close to looking this good, being this easy to use, and having so much functionality that I don&#039;t even have to think or know about. :)
(I&#039;m expecting that to turn into an appropriate emoticon - even my blog had that feature).]]></description>

Quick lists (rather than comprehensive ones) follow.
Pros: can be hosted on own server, flexible (supports a wide range of plugins and themes), has many free plugins and themes, popular (support likely to continue for quite some time and posts are likely to be importable to future equivalents), can be very quick and easy to use (even when posting rich content), supports features that make management easier (such as comment approval) likely to be kept compatible with all major browsers, can be administered from a mobile device (Android has an app, from which I approved your comment), is likely to be patched against security flaws, is free and likely to remain so.
Cons: Not self-written, writing plugins and themes of my own is likely to be more complex than for simpler software, no validity guarantees (XHTML, RSS, CSS), is likely to have security flaws searched for and found, probably uses more of the resources available for g400.co.uk than everything else that exists there put together due to complexity.]]></description>
