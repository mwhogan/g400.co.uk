Obviously the city deal that Cambridge may get would significantly help with funding the constuction but there are other methods of raising money, depending on how much is needed and how aggressively adoption of the system is to be pushed. One aggressive solution for the phases depicted could involve city-wide parking restrictions that penalize overnight parking to ensure that the beneficiaries (residents of the city) are incentivised to use the system (residents who want a car for travel within Cambridge should put a garage-like facility higher up their list of priorities and those who need to travel by car outside of Cambridge could use the Park and Ride car parks for overnight parking). Further phases, to nearby towns and villages, could be funded via a city-wide congestion charge. However, if such an anti-car philosophy is being followed, it might be cheaper to simply convert most of Cambridge&#8217;s main roads into a tram-like surface-level light rail system, leaving enough roads for access (residential, commercial and emergency).<\/p>\n<p>In the image below I&#8217;ve tried to envision what a smart card for the Cambridge Automated Metro (the equivalent of an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oyster_card\">Oyster Card<\/a>) would look like.
